<text><section>Sec. 8AA-8. Term of license.<section>No license, including a renewal license, shall be issued for a term longer than ten (10) years. A licensee holding a current license under any previous ordinance may file for a renewal of its license pursuant to the terms of this chapter which shall require adequate notice to the public and opportunity to comment and may have its license renewed for additional periods of no longer than ten (10) years duration. New and renewal licenses will receive terms that will coordinate with the terms of existing licenses so that in the future all licenses will expire and be subject to renewal simultaneously. Notwithstanding, a license may be extended for a period of greater than ten (10) years to accomplish the policy goal of having existing licenses expire and be subject to renewal simultaneously.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
