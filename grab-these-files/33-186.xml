<text><section>Sec. 33-186. Commercial and other service uses.<section>No part of the park shall be used for commercial purposes except such uses as are required for servicing the park residents, and such uses shall be located at least two hundred (200) feet from any perimeter boundary line of the park. Such "servicing uses" may include BU-1 type business uses, launderettes, day nurseries, and mobile home model display areas for sales or rental purposes, provided each displayed mobile home shall be on an approved individual mobile home space. Such commercial and service uses shall be established only when shown on the site plan which has been approved after public hearing.
