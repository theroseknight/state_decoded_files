These benefits include actual use by residents of such development and aesthetic, recreational, and environmental benefits to the residential area and its population. These benefits accrue to all properties and residents of the area.</section><section prefix='(d)'>The purpose of this chapter is to provide not only for the minimum level of service established by the CDMP, but also for the additional public park open space and recreation facilities necessary to adequately serve the impacts and demands of new residential development; and to require that future residential growth contribute its fair share to the cost of additions and improvements to the County's public park system in amounts reasonably anticipated to offset the impacts and demands generated by such growth.
