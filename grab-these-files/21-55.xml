<text><section>Sec. 21-55. Same—Appeals from denied, suspended or revoked license.<section>Any person who is denied a license or whose license is suspended or revoked by the Director may appeal to the County Commission by filing a written petition for review setting forth the reasons why the license should have been granted or should not have been suspended or revoked, as the case may be, but the Commission shall have no jurisdiction to entertain any such appeal unless the petition for review is filed with the Clerk of the Commission within thirty (30) days after the date of the Director's action. If the Commission hears testimony regarding the denial, suspension, or revocation of the license, all witnesses shall be sworn and the laws of evidence applicable to quasi-judicial proceedings shall govern.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
