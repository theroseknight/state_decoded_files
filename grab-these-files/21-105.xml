<text><section>Sec. 21-105. Method of forfeiting.<section>Any or all of an inmate's additional gain time allowance may be forfeited for violation of any rule or regulation of the Department by such inmate. The method of forfeiture shall be as follows: A written charge shall be prepared, which shall specify the Department rule or regulation the inmate is accused of violating and the approximate date of such violation. A copy of such charge shall be delivered to the prisoner and he shall be given notice of hearing before a disciplinary committee created by the Department. He shall be present at such hearing. If at such hearing the prisoner pleads guilty to the charge or such committee determines from the proof presented that he is guilty thereof, it shall find him guilty; and if it considers that all or a part of the prisoner's additional gain time should be forfeited, it shall so recommend in its written report, which shall be presented to the Director of the Department. The Director may thereupon, at his discretion, declare the forfeiture approved or any part thereof.</section></section></text><history>(Ord. No. 71-73, ยง 5, 9-22-71; Ord.
