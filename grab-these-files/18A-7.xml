Landscape plans shall be reviewed in accordance with the following goals and objectives and the guidelines and illustrations provided in the Landscape Manual as well as the Guide to Florida-Friendly Landscaping provided by the Florida Yards and Neighborhoods Program:<section prefix='(A)'>Landscape design shall enhance architectural features; relate structure design to the site; visually screen dissimilar uses and unsightly views; reduce noise, glare and heat gain from paved areas, major roadways and incompatible uses; strengthen important vistas and reinforce neighboring site design and architecture.</section><section prefix='(B)'>Existing specimen trees, native vegetation (including canopy, understory, and ground cover) and Natural Forest Communities shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible and all requirements of Section 24-49 of the Code of Miami-Dade County shall be met. Preserved Natural Forest Community areas shall be deducted from the total area used to calculate minimum landscaping requirements. Native vegetation in these Natural Forest Community areas shall not be used to satisfy minimum landscape requirements.</section><section prefix='(C)'>In order to conserve water, reduce maintenance, and promote plant health, plant species shall be selected and installed based on their water needs, growth rate and size, and resource inputs.

Where feasible, the re-establishment of native habitats shall be incorporated into the landscape plan.</section><section prefix='(E)'>Trees and shrubs shall be planted in the energy conservation zone where feasible, in order to reduce energy consumption by shading buildings and shall be used to reduce heat island effects by shading paved surfaces.</section><section prefix='(F)'>Street trees shall be used to shade roadways and provide visual order. Where feasible, selected species shall be used to establish a road hierarchy by defining different road types.</section><section prefix='(G)'>Special attention shall be given to the use of appropriate species located under, or adjacent to overhead power lines, and near native plant communities and near underground utility lines. Adequate growth area shall be provided for all plant materials.</section><section prefix='(H)'>Landscaping shall be designed in such a way as to provide safe and unobstructed views at intersections of roadways, driveways, recreational paths and sidewalks in accordance with Section 33-11 of the Code.</section><section prefix='(I)'>Historic landscapes and landscape features designated by local, State or federal governments shall be preserved.</section></section></section></text><history>(Ord.
