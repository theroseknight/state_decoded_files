After commission approval, the manager shall thereafter issue a certificate provided that the applicant has complied with the requirements of this article and presents proof of approval by the appropriate state agency or agencies, including a list of all drivers, emergency medical technicians, and paramedics and a list of all permitted vehicles. No certificate shall be issued unless the applicant has presented proof of insurance, as required by this article, and paid a certificate issuance fee, as specified by Section 4-5, and passed the required inspections as provided in Florida Statutes, Chapter 401, including an annual County inspection of private vehicles and paid a County annual private permit fee for each active and reserve vehicle to be operated. If the applicant fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection within one hundred twenty (120) days after notification of commission approval, such approval shall be automatically revoked and no certificate shall be issued, provided that the county manager may extend such period if good cause be shown, provided the total time period shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a certificate holder may elect to phase in the operation of the total number of authorized vehicles approved by the Board. At no time shall a certificate holder operate less than five (5) active units. If a certificate holder elects to phase into operation the number of units approved by the Board, the certificate holder is required to have vehicle permits issued by the County on all of the Board-approved active and reserve units, on or before two (2) years following the date of approval of the certificate. Failure to comply with this provision shall cause the certificate to be amended and reissued reflecting the actual number of operational units on such date.</section><section prefix='(f)'>Certificate forms. Each certificate shall contain, at a minimum: the name and address of the applicant; the maximum number of active ambulances authorized to operate, the maximum number of reserve vehicles permitted to serve as temporary replacement units for active vehicles, the date on which the private certificate expires and such additional terms, conditions, provisions and limitations as were authorized in the approval process.</section><section prefix='(g)'>Assignment, sale or transfer of certificate. No certificate issued under this article shall be sold, assigned or transferred or the ownership structure of the certificate holder changed or altered so as to result in a change or the possibility of a change in the control of said certificate to another until such transaction or change in control has been approved by the commission in the same manner and subject to the same application, investigation, fees and public hearing as original applications for certificates. Any transfer of shares of stock or interest of any person or certificate holder so as to cause a change in the directors, officers, or managers of such person or certificate holder shall be deemed a transfer or assignment as contemplated in this section and subject to the same rules and regulations as any other transfer or assignment. Upon approval by the Board of a transaction, a new certificate shall be issued. At such time, the original certificate shall become invalid. The provisions of this section shall not apply to transfers from one (1) governmental entity to another governmental entity.</section><section prefix='(h)'>Applications to increase vehicles. Following a minimum of six (6) months in operation, a private certificate holder may submit an application to request an increase in the number of authorized active ground vehicles. No increase shall be authorized unless the certificate holder submits verifiable documentation which demonstrates that the certificate holder's trips-to-car ratio is equivalent to or exceeds five (5) trips per active vehicle, per average weekday for the sixty (60) consecutive weekdays (Monday through Friday) preceding the date of application. The 5:1 trips-to-car ratio shall be calculated as follows: total number of trips where a patient is transported for the sixty (60) weekdays, divided by sixty (60) weekdays, divided by the number of authorized active vehicles. The County Mayor or designee shall only authorize the number of additional active vehicles necessary to lower the applicant's average weekday trips per active vehicle ratio below the 5:1 threshold. All increases in the number of active vehicles shall be reported to the Commission on a semiannual basis. The applicant may also request a proportionate increase in reserve units in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-8 (l).
