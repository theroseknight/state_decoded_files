<text><section>Sec. 29-126. [Applicable only to construction or reconstruction after January 7, 2003.]<section>The reduction in assessed value provided by this ordinance shall only apply to construction or reconstruction to an existing homestead that occurred after January 7, 2003, and is completed prior to January 1 of the year for which the reduction in assessed value is sought. The reduction in assessed value shall only apply for taxable years during which at least one such parent or grandparent maintains his or her primary place of residence in such living quarters within the homestead property of the owner. As used herein, the term "primary place of residence" shall have the same meaning as "permanent residency" for establishing homestead exemption pursuant to Section 196.031, Florida Statutes. The property appraiser may rely upon the factors listed in Section 196.015, Florida Statutes, in determining whether the property is the primary place of residence for the applicant's parent or grandparent.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
