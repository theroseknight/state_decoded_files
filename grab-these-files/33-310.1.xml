<text><section>Sec. 33-310.1. Administrative modification or elimination of conditions and restrictive covenants.<section prefix='A.'>Standards. The Director is authorized to consider and approve applications to modify or eliminate any condition or part thereof which has been imposed by any final decision adopted by resolution, and to modify or eliminate any restrictive covenant, or part thereof, accepted at public hearing, where the requirements of at least one of the following subsections have been demonstrated. Upon demonstration that such requirements have been met, an application may be approved as to a portion of the property encumbered by the condition or the restrictive covenant where the condition or restrictive covenant is capable of being applied separately and in full force as to the remaining portion of the property that is not a part of the application and both the application portion and the remaining portion of the property will be in compliance with all other applicable requirements of prior zoning actions and of this chapter.<section prefix='I.'>Substantial Compliance With Previous Approval. The Director shall approve an application to modify or eliminate a condition or part thereof, or a restrictive covenant or part thereof, where it is demonstrated that the proposed modification or elimination will result in substantial compliance with the previous zoning action regarding a site plan, as demonstrated by all of the following:<section prefix='(A)'>Development density and intensity have not materially changed, in that:<section prefix='1.'>the number of buildings is not increased by more than 10 percent;</section><section prefix='2.'>the number of stories is the same or fewer;</section><section prefix='3.'>the height of the building(s) is the same or less;</section><section prefix='4.'>the number of units is the same or fewer;</section><section prefix='5.'>the lot coverage and floor area ratio are the same or less;</section><section prefix='6.'>the number of bedrooms and corresponding parking spaces may be increased or decreased by as much as 10%, based on the entire plan, provided the plan complies with all other requirements of this subsection and of this chapter; and</section><section prefix='7.'>density or intensity (floor area ratio) may be transferred from one building to another or from one stage of development to another, provided that the total floor area ratio is not changed.</section></section><section prefix='(B)'>Design has not materially changed, in that:<section prefix='1.'>the roadway patterns, including ingress-egress points, are in the same general location as shown on the original plans, and are no closer to the rear or interior side property lines than shown on the original plans;</section><section prefix='2.'>the parking area is in the same general location and configuration;</section><section prefix='3.'>the building setbacks are the same or greater distance from perimeter property lines, except that the building setbacks for detached single-family development, zero lot line, rowhouse, townhouse and cluster development may also be decreased, provided that such decrease is limited such that the resulting setback distance will be the greater of either<section prefix='(a)'>the underlying zoning district regulations, or</section><section prefix='(b)'>any condition or restrictive covenant regulating the setback for which a substantial compliance determination is sought;</section></section><section prefix='4.'>the landscaped open space is in the same general location, is of the same or greater amount, and is configured in a manner that does not diminish a previously intended buffering effect;</section><section prefix='5.'>the proposed perimeter walls and/or fences are in the same general location and of a comparable type and design as previously approved;</section><section prefix='6.'>elevations and renderings of buildings have substantially similar architectural expressions as those shown on the approved plans;</section><section prefix='7.'>recreational facilities, if shown on plans approved by a prior zoning action, either remain the same or are converted from one recreational use to another;</section><section prefix='8.'>if recreational facilities were not shown in the approved plans, they may be added, provided there is no increase in lot coverage or decrease in required open space and such facilities are located internally within the proposed development;</section><section prefix='9.'>if a variance for signage has been granted, the proposed sign(s) are no greater in size and are placed in the same general location on the site as approved by zoning action. An entrance sign location may be moved the same proportional distance as a relocated entrance drive;</section><section prefix='10.'>the proposed changes do not have the effect of creating any noncompliance or nonconformity with the strict application of the zoning code that were not previously approved at public hearing, or of expanding the scope of existing variances, alternative site development options, or other approvals pursuant to alternative development standards such that they would differ to a greater degree from the strict application of the zoning code;</section><section prefix='11.'>additional outparcels may be added where:<section prefix='(a)'>there is no increase in the project's total floor area ratio or lot coverage;</section><section prefix='(b)'>there is no reduction in the total amount of landscaped open space; and</section><section prefix='(c)'>addition of the outparcel does not result in noncompliance with any other provision of this subsection on any other portion of the subject property.</section></section><section prefix='12.'>reductions in the number of parking spaces on the site are permitted if sufficient parking spaces are provided to satisfy the requirements of this code.</section></section><section prefix='(C)'>The slope of any lake for which a modification is requested complies with Section 33-16 and all other applicable provisions of this code.</section></section><section prefix='II.'>Reformation of Resolutions and Declarations of Restrictive Covenants to Correct Clerical or Scrivener's Errors.<section prefix='(A)'>The Director shall approve an application to reform a clerical or scrivener's error, in a prior zoning action, including an error in an application, declaration of restrictive covenants accepted upon public hearing, or notice, which error causes the zoning action not to accurately reflect the board's intent, and where it is demonstrated that all of the following requirements are met:<section prefix='1.'>the reformation shall not include a change of judgment, policy, or prior intent of the board;</section><section prefix='2.'>prior to the conclusion of the public hearing at which the zoning action for which reformation is sought was taken, the current applicant either did not know of the error, or knew of the error and made it known to the adopting board;</section><section prefix='3.'>the reformation of the previous resolution or declaration is essential to insure that the zoning action reflects the intent of the adopting board;</section><section prefix='4.'>the record, including, but not limited to, the staff recommendation, minutes, and motion, evidences the clear intent of the board;</section><section prefix='5.'>the substance of the decision of the board was evident at the time of the adoption of the zoning action, and there was no intent to deceive the public or the board on the part of the current applicant at any time;</section><section prefix='6.'>failure to approve the reformation would lead to an unjust result;</section><section prefix='7.'>the error in the prior zoning action did not mislead anyone in a way that would cause them to be prejudiced by the reformation; and</section><section prefix='8.'>any errors related to public notice did not affect the legal sufficiency of the required notice.</section></section><section prefix='(B)'>Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Director, within thirty (30) days of the transmittal of a resolution, may reform a clerical or scrivener's error in a zoning action including a declaration of restrictive covenants accepted upon public hearing, without public notice, if:<section prefix='1.'>the error is not related to public notice, and</section><section prefix='2.'>the error causes the resolution or declaration as written to inaccurately reflect the clear decision of the board.</section></section><section prefix='(C)'>A reformed zoning action shall relate back to the original zoning action and the effective date of the corrected language shall be deemed to be the same as the effective date of the previous resolution.</section></section><section prefix='III.'>Modification or Elimination of Conditions and Restrictive Covenants Associated with Voluntarily Abandoned Zoning Actions.
