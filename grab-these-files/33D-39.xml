<text><section>Sec. 33D-39. Judicial review.<section>Whenever any municipal or County authority renders or issues any ordinance, resolution, permit or order in regard to any development action which meets the thresholds set forth in hereinabove or plan within the shoreline development review boundary, a copy of such ordinance, resolution, permit or order shall be submitted forthwith to the County staff coordinator of the Shoreline Development Review Committee. It shall be the duty of the County staff coordinator to place the matter before the Committee as soon as is reasonably practical, and in any event not less than twenty (20) days from the rendition of the ordinance, resolution, permit or order. At its meeting, the Committee shall consider whether, and the extent to which, the municipal or County authority has departed from the requirements of this article. Where it appears that the action of the municipal or County authority is substantially contrary to the Committee's recommendations and report, the Committee may authorize the filing or appropriate judicial proceedings in the Circuit Court for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, to contest the action of the County or municipal authority.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
