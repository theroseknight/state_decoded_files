<text><section>Sec. 32-77. Declaration of legislative intent.<section>This Board (Board of County Commissioners) finds that many residences and nonresidential buildings in Miami-Dade County abut streets and easements in which water and/or sewer mains have been laid but obtain their water supply from wells and not from said mains. The sewage disposal for the said residences is provided by septic tanks. The growing population of Miami-Dade County, the increasing contamination of ground water, the easy passage of water through the porous rock and sub-soil underlying much of Miami-Dade County, particularly in times of heavy rains and high ground water level, combined with the continued use of individual wells, and septic tanks, constitutes a danger to the public health of Miami-Dade County and requires the extension of public water supply and public sewage disposal wherever it is physically feasible.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
