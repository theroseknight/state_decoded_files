Based on recommendations from the County Manager, the County Commission or Public Health Trust may apply the following measures to contracts to address this section's findings of ethnic discrimination experienced by Hispanic business enterprises:<section prefix='1.'>Set-asides. The County Commission or Public Health Trust may determine it is in its best interest to waive competitive bidding or selection requirements and set aside a contract for HBEs in accordance with the following:<section prefix='a.'>The County Commission or Public Health Trust shall determine prior to bid advertisement that there are at least three (3) available HBEs to perform the set-aside contract; or</section><section prefix='b.'>The County Commission or Public Health Trust shall determine prior to bid advertisement that there are at least two (2) available HBEs to perform the set-aside contract and the following conditions are met:<section prefix='i.'>No HBE has been awarded a contract with the County or the Public Health Trust for the goods or services to be advertised in the eighteen (18) preceding months; and</section><section prefix='ii.'>The Department of Procurement Management has prepared an analysis of the price being offered by the recommended awardee to ensure that it is not excessive.</section></section><section prefix='c.'>Joint ventures that are owned and controlled by at least one (1) HBE may bid on set-aside contracts.</section><section prefix='d.'>Transferring through subcontracting or otherwise all or part of the actual work of a set-aside contract to a non-HBE is prohibited unless such transfer receives prior approval from the Department of Business and Economic Development as consistent with normal industry practice.</section><section prefix='e.'>A HBE may compete for contracts that are set aside under the Black Business Enterprise and Women Business Enterprise Programs if certified in accordance with these programs.</section></section><section prefix='2.'>Subcontractor and project goals:<section prefix='a.'>The County Commission or Public Health Trust may establish subcontractor or project goals to be met by HBEs in a contract based on estimates made prior to bid advertisement of the quality, quantity and type of opportunities provided by the contract, and of the availability of at least three HBEs to afford effective competition in providing goods or services under the contract. In instances where there are two (2) available HBEs, the Commission or Trust may apply a subcontractor or project goal where no HBE has participated as a subcontractor to a prime contractor having a contract with the County for the goods or services advertised within the preceding eighteen (18) months. Further, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section of the Code, where a subcontractor or project goal is applied when only two (2) HBEs are available, a bidder who fails to meet the goal may remain eligible for award if the bidder submits written evidence within two (2) business days from bid submission that the prices submitted by HBEs to the bidder were not reasonable compared to those submitted to the bidder by other non-HBE subcontractors. A HBE's bid will be considered reasonably competitive if its bid, for the same scope of work, is within 25 percent of the bid of comparably-sized non-HBE firms. After bid advertisement or other formal public notice, the established subcontractor or project goal may be reduced only with the approval of the County Commission or Public Health Trust.</section><section prefix='b.'>Bid documents shall require bidders to submit a form at the time of bid submission identifying all HBEs to be utilized to meet the subcontractor goal, the scope of work each will perform, including the goods or services each will provide, and the dollar value of such work. In order to assure at the time of bid submission agreement upon the above information between the bidder and the HBE, bid documents shall also require bidders to submit a form no later than two (2) business days after bid submission confirming such information through signed documents from the HBEs involved. Failure to submit the required forms at the specified time shall render the bid nonresponsive. Submission of a defective form shall render the bid voidable.</section><section prefix='c.'>In contracts with subcontractor or project goals for Black or Women business enterprises, a HBE certified as a Black or Women business enterprise shall be counted toward meeting the goal for one (1) category only. The prime bidder shall declare at bid submission toward which subcontractor goal a business enterprise certified in more than one (1) category shall count.</section><section prefix='d.'>Bidders whose bids fail to meet a subcontractor goal, in order to remain eligible for award of the contract, must submit evidence, no later than two (2) business days after bid submission, proving the lack of available HBEs to afford effective competition in providing goods or services under the contract to meet the goal. Inability of a HBE to obtain bonding at the bidder's request may not be sufficient proof of such HBE's lack of availability.</section><section prefix='e.'>A successful bidder that is a HBE or a joint venture owned and controlled by a HBE may comply with up to one-half (½) of the subcontractor goal set for the contract by performing work with its own forces.</section><section prefix='f.'>Bid documents shall provide that expenditures to subcontracting joint ventures shall be counted toward meeting specified goals only when such joint ventures are owned and controlled by at least one (1) HBE.</section><section prefix='g.'>Bid documents shall provide that:<section prefix='i.'>Only expenditures to subcontracting HBEs for performing a commercially useful function shall be counted toward meeting a subcontractor goal;</section><section prefix='ii.'>Expenditures to subcontracting HBEs for acting essentially as a broker to a non-HBE shall not be counted toward meeting a subcontractor goal; and</section><section prefix='iii.'>Expenditures to subcontracting HBEs who subcontract work further to non-HBEs shall not be counted toward meeting a specified goal unless such subcontracting receives prior approval from the Department of Business and Economic Development as consistent with normal industry practice.</section></section><section prefix='h.'>Bid documents shall allow bidders to challenge or protest a subcontractor or project goal by submitting no later than the time of bid submission the reasons for such challenge or protest in writing to the department responsible for the contract. Such challenges or protests by bidders after the time of bid submission shall not be heard by the County Commission or Public Health Trust.</section></section><section prefix='3.'>Bid preferences:<section prefix='a.'>The County Commission or Public Health Trust may authorize a bid preference on contracts which are to be awarded to the responsive and responsible bidder with the lowest price and which are not set aside. The bid preference shall be used only to evaluate a bid and shall not affect the contract price.</section><section prefix='b.'>Contracts may give a bid preference in an amount of up to ten (10) percent of the bid price to bidders that:<section prefix='i.'>Are HBEs;</section><section prefix='ii.'>Are joint ventures; or</section><section prefix='iii.'>Demonstrate significant utilization of HBEs in their purchases in Miami-Dade County of goods and services, as set forth in bid documents or administrative orders.</section></section><section prefix='c.'>Bidders that significantly utilize HBEs in their purchases in Miami-Dade County of goods or services, in order to receive a bid preference, shall list at the time of bid submission or as may otherwise be specified their purchases in Miami-Dade County of goods and services and their utilization of HBEs in such purchases for the twenty-four-month period prior to bid submission. Purchases in Miami-Dade County of goods and services required by any local, state or federal ethnic-conscious measures shall not be recognized for purposes of calculating bid preferences.</section><section prefix='d.'>Joint ventures must be approved prior to bid opening to establish the percentage of HBE participation which will be recognized. The HBE member of the joint venture shall perform work, manage the job and take financial risks in proportion to its level of participation in the joint venture. Agreements establishing joint ventures shall be in writing. Bid and contract documents shall require that the portion of the work to be performed by the HBE member of the joint venture be set forth in detail separately from the work to be performed by the non-HBE member.</section></section><section prefix='4.'>HBE selection factor. The County Commission or Public Health Trust may authorize the use of a HBE selection factor as one (1) basis for deciding among bids for contracts to be awarded upon criteria in addition to price and not set aside under subsection (3)(c)1 above.<section prefix='a.'>In bids that assign weights to evaluation or selection criteria, bid documents shall assign a weight of ten (10) percent to the HBE selection factor. In bids that do not assign weights to evaluation or selection criteria, bid documents shall provide that among bidders evaluated to be otherwise substantially equal, the HBE selection factor shall be the deciding factor for award of the bid.</section><section prefix='b.'>Any committee formed to evaluate a bid with a HBE selection factor shall include a voting representative from the Department of Business and Economic Development.</section></section></section><section prefix='(d)'>Review committee. The County Manager shall establish an administrative procedure for the review of each proposed County contract to which this section applies, including the establishment of a committee to recommend whether the measures provided in subsection (3)(c) above should be applied.</section><section prefix='(e)'>Certification.<section prefix='1.'>The County Manager shall implement eligibility criteria and procedures for entities to be certified as HBEs.<section prefix='a.'>Such criteria shall set limits on the size of HBEs based on regulations of the Small Business Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce for "small business concerns," presently codified at 13 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 121, Subpart A.</section><section prefix='b.'>Any HBE that exceeds the size limits established by this subparagraph shall be allowed to retain its certification for one (1) additional year from the date it is formally notified it has exceeded the size limits.</section></section><section prefix='2.'>The Department of Business and Economic Development shall maintain and publish at least every other week an updated list of HBEs, identifying each listed HBE based on the nature of the goods and/or services the HBE shall be certified to supply.</section><section prefix='3.'>The Department of Business and Economic Development shall not certify an applicant, shall not recertify a HBE, and shall decertify a HBE that fails to comply with the criteria or procedures for obtaining or maintaining certification. The Department of Business and Economic Development shall have authority to suspend the certification of a HBE during any appeal of a decertification decision.</section><section prefix='4.'>Certification shall be renewed annually, and must be in effect at the time of bid submission, bid award, and throughout the duration of the contract. HBEs experiencing changes in ownership shall notify the Department of Business and Economic Development within thirty (30) days of the effective date of such changes.</section><section prefix='5.'>Applicants and certified HBEs must perform a commercially useful function to be eligible for certification or remain certified.</section><section prefix='6.'>A Hispanic individual, alone or as a member of a group, shall be eligible to have a business certified as a HBE only if an Hispanic owner personally possesses the licenses and satisfies the qualifying requirements established by a board regulating the industry in which certification is sought.</section><section prefix='7.'>A Hispanic individual, alone or as a member of a group, shall own or control only one (1) HBE at a time and shall not own and control another separate business certified under the Black Business Enterprise or Women Business Enterprise Programs.</section><section prefix='8.'>A Hispanic individual, alone or as a member of a group, and any HBE may not hold more than twenty-five (25) percent equity ownership in any other HBE in the same or similar line of business. If a non-HBE in the same or similar line of business as an applicant or existing HBE has an equity ownership of such HBE that exceeds twenty-five (25) percent, the applicant or existing HBE shall not be certified.</section><section prefix='9.'>The Department of Business and Economic Development may require applicants and HBEs to submit information regarding their business operations, including but not limited to a breakdown of the applicant's or HBE's work force as to race, national origin and gender.</section><section prefix='10.'>Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit a Hispanic individual from being certified under the Black Business Enterprise or Women Business Enterprise Programs.</section></section><section prefix='(f)'>Prompt payment.<section prefix='1.'>The County Manager and the President of the Public Health Trust shall establish administrative procedures requiring that billings from HBEs that have signed contracts with Miami-Dade County or the Public Health Trust be promptly reviewed and payment made on those amounts not in dispute within thirty (30) days of receipt of billing.</section><section prefix='2.'>Contracts to which any of the provisions of subsection (3)(c)2 above are applied shall require that billings from HBEs that are under contract with the successful bidder be promptly reviewed and payment made to such HBEs on those amounts not in dispute within thirty (30) days of receipt by the successful bidder of such billings. Such contracts shall include provisions for subcontracting HBEs to grieve intentional, wrongful delays in payment by the successful bidder to the HBE and for penalties and sanctions for such delays, including debarment.</section></section><section prefix='(g)'>Sanctions for contractual violations.
