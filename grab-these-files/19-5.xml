<text><section>Sec. 19-5. Collection of Enforcement and Remediation Costs.<section>The Director shall certify the expense incurred in remedying a public nuisance under of this Chapter, including advertising, clearing, hauling, disposal and other expenses, together with an administrative fee as authorized in the Department's administrative fee schedule. The owner, or other responsible party, shall pay the cost within thirty (30) days. If the owner, or other responsible party, fails to pay the costs, the Director shall place a special assessment lien against the lot for the total amount due. Such a lien shall accrue interest at the legal rate from the date of certification until it is paid. The Director shall keep among his records the documentation relating to the amount payable for liens against lots remedied by the County.</section><section>A special assessment lien shall be enforceable in the same manner as a tax lien in favor of Miami-Dade County and may be satisfied at any time by payment thereof, including accrued interest. Upon payment the Clerk of the Circuit Court shall, by appropriate means, evidence the satisfaction and cancellation of such lien upon the record thereof. Notice of a special assessment lien may be filed in the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court and recorded among the public records of Dade County, Florida.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
