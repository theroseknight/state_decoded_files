<text><section>Sec. 15-23. Solid waste fees; joint and several liability.<section>In any area in which solid waste collection services are provided by the Department, it shall be the responsibility of the owner(s) of any lot, tract or parcel of land upon which a residential unit, commercial establishment or multi-family residential establishment is located, to pay or cause to be paid the solid waste fee(s) due for each such unit or establishment, as applicable, as provided for in hereof. The failure of the owner(s) to pay such fee(s) shall constitute a violation of this chapter, for which, in the case of multiple owners, there shall be joint and several liability. In the case of multi-family residential establishments which are condominiums or cooperative apartments, the condominium or cooperative association, rather than the individual unit owners, shall be jointly and severally liable pursuant to this paragraph. Solid waste collection may be discontinued from premises for which the solid waste fee(s) has/have not been paid, and the owners or occupants thereof may be subject to the provisions of hereof.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
