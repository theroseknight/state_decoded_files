<text><section>Sec. 10-33.02.1. Bids precluded from related parties and colluding bidders.<section prefix='(a)'>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, when two (2) or more related parties each submit a bid or proposal for any construction contract subject to this article, such bid or proposal shall be presumed collusive. The foregoing presumption may be rebutted by presentation of evidence as to the extent of ownership, control and management of such related parties in the preparation and submittal of such bids or proposals. Related parties shall mean bidders or proposers, or principals, corporate officers, and managers thereof which have a direct or indirect ownership interest in another bidder or proposer for the same contract or in which a parent company or the principals thereof of one (1) bidder or proposer have a direct or indirect ownership in another bidder or proposer for the same contract. Bids or proposals found to be collusive shall be rejected.</section><section prefix='(b)'>All bids or proposals submitted for any construction contract must be genuine and not sham or collusive or made in the interest or in behalf of any person not therein named, and that the contractor has not, directly or indirectly, induced or solicited any other proposer to put in a sham proposal, or any other person, firm, or corporation to refrain from proposing, and that the proposer has not in any manner sought by collusion to secure to the proposer an advantage over any other proposer. Any bid or proposal submitted in violation of this subsection shall be rejected and the proposer shall be subject to debarment.</section><section prefix='(c)'>A contractor recommended for award as the result of a competitive solicitation for any County construction contract shall, within five (5) business days of the filing of such recommendation, submit an affidavit under the penalty of perjury, on a form provided by the County: stating either that the contractor is not related to any of the other parties bidding in the competitive solicitation or identifying all related parties, as defined in this Section, which bid in the solicitation; and attesting that the contractor's proposal is genuine and not sham or collusive or made in the interest or on behalf of any person not therein named, and that the contractor has not, directly or indirectly, induced or solicited any other proposer to put in a sham proposal, or any other person, firm, or corporation to refrain from proposing, and that the proposer has not in any manner sought by collusion to secure to the proposer an advantage over any other proposer. In the event a recommended contractor identifies related parties in the competitive solicitation, its bid shall be presumed to be collusive and the recommended contractor shall be ineligible for award unless that presumption is rebutted in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any person or entity that fails to submit the required affidavit shall be ineligible for contract award.</section></section></text><history>(Ord. No. 91-32, ยง 4(10-33.1), 3-5-91; Ord.
