<text><section>Sec. 15-15. Private disposal of waste.<section>Any person may be issued a permit by the Health Department to dispose of garbage or solid waste materials accumulated upon his own premises by burial, provided that such method meets all specifications of the Director of the Health Department and evidence is presented of compliance with zoning regulations, but such permit and the disposal thereby authorized shall not relieve the owner or occupant of the premises from payment of regular waste fees. No fee shall be charged for such permit and the same may be renewed each year provided all specifications of the Health Department are observed.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
