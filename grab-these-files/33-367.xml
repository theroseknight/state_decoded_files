<text><section>Sec. 33-367. Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed.<section>Whenever the Director determines that a nonconforming use, structure or tree has been abandoned or is more than fifty (50) percent burned, torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted for reconstruction that would permit such structure or tree to violate height limits or use standards of this article. Whether application is made for a permit under this paragraph or not, the Director may, by appropriate action, require the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree to permit the Miami-Dade County Port Authority at its expense to lower, remove, or mark, or mark and light such object as may be necessary to conform to these regulations.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
