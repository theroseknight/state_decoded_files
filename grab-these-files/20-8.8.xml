<text><section>Sec. 20-8.8. Retention of modification or deletion of covenants or declaration of restrictions.<section>The Board of County Commissioners shall require, as a condition of municipal boundary change, that the Board retain jurisdiction over the modification or deletion of declarations of restrictive covenants accepted by either the Board or a Community Zoning Appeals Board in connection with a Comprehensive Development Master Plan application or zoning application, regardless of whether such declaration provides for modification or deletion by a successor governmental body. It is provided, however, that the Board of County Commissioners may not exercise such jurisdiction unless the applicable municipality has first approved the modification or deletion.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
