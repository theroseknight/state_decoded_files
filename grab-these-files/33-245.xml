<text><section>Sec. 33-245. Business property adjacent to residential districts.<section>Where a business lot abuts an AU, GU, RU or EU zoned property, a decorative masonry wall at least five (5) feet in height shall be erected on the business lots along the common property line separating the two (2) districts. Where a dedicated alley separates the two (2) districts, the five-foot decorative masonry wall shall be erected along the business lots adjacent to the alley, permitting only openings for egress and ingress purposes with the smallest width possible for this purpose. Where the business property is a through lot, and the rear of the business lot lies across the street right-of-way from AU, GU, RU or EU zoned property, said wall shall be located on the business lot ten (10) feet in from the official right-of-way line at the rear of the lot, and the ten-foot strip shall be substantially landscaped. The Director shall determine which part of the lot is the rear property line. No wall will be required along the front property line of the business lot where the same is separated from a residential zone by a street. Where the common property line between the two (2) districts is an interior side property line, the required wall shall extend only to a point fifteen (15) feet from the official front property line.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
