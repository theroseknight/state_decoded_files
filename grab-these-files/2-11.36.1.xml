The foregoing notwithstanding, this article shall not apply to citizen groups created for specific advisory purposes where such group's existence is limited to a period of less than one (1) year. Except as otherwise provided, "County boards" and "citizens' advisory groups" may only be created by action of the County Commission, and only the County Commission, as a body, may appoint the members of the such boards and groups.</section><section prefix='(b)'>Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, no board, committee, task force, or other citizens' group created by a County Commissioner for the purpose of advising him or her with regard to issues solely within his or her district shall be deemed a County "board" as that term is defined herein. Such a "district board" shall, however, be governed by Florida's "Government in the Sunshine Law," Section 286.011, Florida Statutes, and the County's and Florida's Code of Ethics Laws, Section 2-11.1 of the Code of Miami-Dade County and Chapter 112, Part III, Florida Statutes, as those laws may be amended from time to time.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
