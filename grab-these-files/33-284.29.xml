<text><section>Sec. 33-284.29. Legislative purposes.<section>The Office Park District (OPD) incorporates a concept which delineates an open space character for buildings whose principal uses are administrative, professional or research. The major objectives to be achieved by this district are to provide office complexes in an open space environment, to provide freedom for the designer to take a creative approach to the development of an office park and thereby to enhance the visual quality of Miami-Dade County, to encourage developers to seek professional design expertise in the design of office parks, to promote the use of energy saving techniques, to provide a variety of office uses with associated service facilities, and to encourage the efficient use of land with reduction of street and utility networks.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
