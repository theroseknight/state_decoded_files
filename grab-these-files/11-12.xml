<text><section>Sec. 11-12. Additional surcharge for court facilities.<section>In addition to any other fine, penalty, or cost imposed by any other provision of law, a thirty dollar ($30.00) surcharge is hereby imposed upon any conviction or finding of guilt, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld, on each civil traffic infraction referenced in section 318.14, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time, and upon any conviction, plea of nolo contendere or finding of guilt, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld, on each criminal traffic violation referenced in section 318.17, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time. The court shall not waive this surcharge. The Clerk of the Court shall collect the thirty dollar ($30.00) surcharge established in this section and shall remit it to Miami-Dade County. All proceeds from this surcharge shall be used to fund state court facilities as required by general law. The funding of state court facilities includes but is not limited to payment of debt service on any bonds issued to finance state court facilities. It is the intent of the Board that $15.00 of the $30.00 surcharge be used to pay principal and interest on bonds for the Children's Courthouse and other costs related to the Children's Courthouse.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
