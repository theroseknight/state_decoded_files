<text><section>Sec. 8A-157. Notification of customer.<section>In the event that a determination is made that the actual charges for the repairs to be made will exceed the total written estimate for repairs given under by the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) or ten (10) percent of the total written estimate, whichever is less, the customer shall be immediately notified by fax, telephone, telegram, mail or written notice of the new estimate charges. Such notification shall be at the expense of the person engaged in the business of motorboat repairs. A customer so notified may authorize the repairs based upon the new estimate charges or may cancel the order for repairs. (If the customer authorizes or cancels by telephone, it must be confirmed in writing.) If the order for repair is cancelled by the customer, the unrepaired or partially repaired motorboat shall be released immediately, in reasonable like condition as and where received for repair and upon payment of whatever charge is imposed for the release of the unrepaired motorboat in an amount not to exceed the estimate therefor as provided in(4) hereof, if such estimate was included in the written estimate of repairs.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
