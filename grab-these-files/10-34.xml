<text><section>Sec. 10-34. Listing of subcontractors required.<section>The requirements of this section shall apply to those county and Public Health Trust construction contracts in which a bidder may use a subcontractor which involve the expenditure of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or more. Such contracts shall require the entity contracting with the county to list all first tier subcontractors who will perform any part of the contract and all suppliers who will supply materials for the contract work direct to such entity. The contract shall also require the entity contracting with the County to report to the County the race, gender, and ethnic origin of the owners and employees of all such first tier subcontractors. When a competitive process is utilized to select the entity that will contract with the county, the specifications shall provide that it shall be a condition of award for the successful bidder to provide the listing of subcontractors, if required. The contract shall require the contractor to provide to the County the race, gender and ethnic information as soon as reasonably available and in any event prior to final payment under the contract. The Mayor or Mayor's designee shall include language in all contracts to which this section applies to implement this section and to provide that the contractor shall not change or substitute subcontractors or suppliers from those listed except upon written approval of the County.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
