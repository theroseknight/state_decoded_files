Whenever County office development is proposed for that portion of the Rapid Transit Zone surrounding the Douglas Road Metrorail Station, the directors of the Departments of Planning and Zoning, the Miami-Dade Transit Agency and the department proposing the development shall develop proposed master plan development standards for such proposed uses. The standards shall contain, at a minimum: (a) maximum height of the building; (b) maximum floor area ratio; (c) maximum parking provided; (d) minimum open space; (e) minimum setbacks from property lines; (f) gross and net land area; (g) criteria for pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems; (h) signage criteria; (i) criteria for parking layouts and drives; and (j) features demonstrating conformity with the guidelines for development of urban centers contained in the Comprehensive Development Master Plan, conformity with the Miami-Dade County Urban Design Manual, and consistency with the Metrorail Compendium of Design Criteria. Upon the consent of the county manager, the proposed standards shall be submitted to the affected municipality's governing board for review and approval.<section>In reviewing the standards, the municipality shall consider the type of function involved, the public need therefor, the existing land use pattern in the area and the nature of the impact of the facility on the surrounding property. The municipal governing board shall have the power to approve or reject the standards, but shall not modify the standards as submitted. Unless extended by agreement with the County Manager, failure of the municipal governing board to reach a final decision on the proposed development standards within 60 days after receipt of the standards may be deemed by the County to be a lack of objection to the standards as proposed. If the municipal governing board rejects the proposed development standards, the proposed County office development shall not be permitted at the site unless the Board of County Commissioners determines after duly noticed public hearing that the proposed development is of County-wide necessity and significance, and upon such determination approves the development standards in accordance with the criteria applicable to the municipal governing board.</section><section>After approval of the development standards, a site plan consistent with the approved development standards shall be submitted to the Director of the Department of Planning and Zoning. After review by the Directors of the Departments of Planning and Zoning, the Miami-Dade Transit Agency and the department seeking development approval, the County Manager may submit the site plan to the Board of County Commissioners with a recommendation for approval.</section><section>The Board of County Commissioners may authorize the development and approve the site plan by resolution following public hearing. The public hearing shall be held upon 15 days' notice of the time and place of the hearing published in a newspaper of general circulation in Miami-Dade County, which publication shall include the time and place of hearing before the Board of County Commissioners. A courtesy notice containing general information as to the date, time and place of the hearing, the property location and general nature of the proposed development may be mailed to the property owners of record within a radius of three hundred (300) feet of the property described in the application, or such greater distance as the County Manager may provide; provided, however, that failure to mail or receive such courtesy notice shall not affect any action or proceeding taken hereunder. To provide additional notice to the public, the property may be posted by a sign or signs indicating the action desired and the time and place of public hearing thereon. Failure to post the property shall not affect any action taken hereunder. At the public hearing, the Board shall consider, among other factors, the type of function involved, the public need therefor, the existing land use pattern in the area, alternative locations for the facility and the nature of the impact of the development on the surrounding property.</section><section>This process shall apply only to that portion of the Rapid Transit Zone surrounding the Douglas Road Metrorail Station.</section></section></section><section prefix='(E)'>Effect on existing land uses.

The Board of County Commissioners, after giving public notice as required by Chapter 33 of the Code, shall hear the appeal and either affirm, deny or modify the decision of the Agency.
