Subdivision of portion of tract.<section>The owner or developer of a tract may prepare a master plan for that entire tract and then may submit a tentative and final plat for only a portion of the tract. No construction of subdivision improvements shall be started until construction plans for the entire area covered by the final plat have been approved. Except as provided in(c), improvements must be installed for all of that area for which a final plat is submitted before building permits will be issued. In such cases of partial subdivision of a tract, the street system, drainage systems, trunk sewers and sewage treatment plants and water plants shall be designed and built to serve the entire area, or designed and built in such a manner as to be easily expanded or extended to service the entire area.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
