<text><section>Sec. 2-2013. Program described—No rights conveyed.<section>It is the intention of Miami-Dade County to publish advertising in the periodicals that qualify and become a part of this program. No rights to receive advertising contracts are granted by qualifying for or participating in this program. The decision of whether, what, and how much to publish in a particular periodical remains in the sole discretion of Miami-Dade County, which may consider any lawful factor in making its decision including, but not limited to, rates, target audience, frequency and consistency of publication, while advertising rates shall remain the sole discretion of the individual periodical operating in a free market economy. The exercise of the County's discretion in this regard shall not be subject to any appeal. Nothing herein shall restrict the ability of an individual periodical to adopt whatever rate it deems appropriate, provided that Miami-Dade County may decline to purchase advertising based upon the rate. The Department charged with administering this program may periodically issue its own rate ceiling cards indicating the maximum amounts that it will pay for various categories of advertising.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
