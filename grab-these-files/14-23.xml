<text><section>Sec. 14-23. Setting fires during emergency drought conditions.<section>It is unlawful for any person to set fire to any forest, grass, woods, wild lands or marshes, or to build a campfire or bonfire or to burn trash or other material that may cause a forest, grass or woods fire, within the County, or area within the county, when because of emergency drought conditions, as defined in Section 590.08, Florida Statutes, there is extraordinary danger from fire, unless the setting of any backfire during the drought emergency is necessary to afford protection as determined by a representative of the Florida Board of Forestry, or unless it can be established that the setting of such backfire was necessary for the purpose of saving life or property. The burden of proving such shall rest on such person claiming same as a defense.</section></section></text><history>(Ord. No. 66-24, ยง 3, 6-7-66)</history></law>
