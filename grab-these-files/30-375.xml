<text><section>Sec. 30-375. Rough surfaced wheels prohibited.<section>No person shall drive, propel, operate or cause to be driven, propelled or operated over any paved or graded public road of this County any tractor engine, tractor or other vehicle or contrivance having wheels provided with sharpened or roughened surfaces, other than roughened pneumatic rubber tires having studs designed to improve traction without materially injuring the surface of the highway, unless the rims or tires of the wheels of such tractor engines, tractors or other vehicles or contrivances are provided with suitable filler blocks between the cleats so as to form a smooth surface. This requirement shall not apply to tractor engines, tractors or other vehicles or contrivances if the rims or tires of their wheels are constructed in such manner as to prevent injury to such roads; provided, this restriction shall not apply to tractor engines, tractors and other vehicles or implements used by any County or the Department of Transportation in the construction or maintenance of roads or to farm implements weighing less than one thousand (1,000) pounds when provided with wheel surfaces of more than one-half (½) inch in width.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
