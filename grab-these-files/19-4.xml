<text><section>Sec. 19-4. Responsibility for compliance.<section>It is the responsibility of each owner to maintain their property in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. Where applicable, tenants or lessees shall receive enforcement notices in connection with enforcement; however, the owner is ultimately responsible for compliance with this chapter.</section><section>The holder and/or owner of any mortgage which is upon real property which is in violation of this chapter shall be a responsible party for compliance with this chapter upon the filing of a lis pendens and/or an action, the purpose of which is to foreclose upon the mortgage or similar instrument that secures debt upon the real property. The responsibility for compliance with this chapter of a mortgage owner/holder shall be effective, in the case of a single-family residential unit, only during periods of time that the residential unit shall be vacant and in foreclosure. In all instances, the responsibility of a holder/owner of a mortgage shall remain until such time as the property is sold or transferred to a new owner, or the foreclosure action described herein is dismissed.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
