<text><section>Sec. 33I-12. Refund of impact fees paid.<section prefix='(a)'>If a building permit encompassing feepaying development expires or is revoked, or if the feepayer has paid impact fees in excess of the amount determined by an approved independent fee computation study completed in accordance with conditions set forth in Section 33I-9, then the feepayer may request from the Director of the Department of Planning and Zoning a refund of the impact fee paid or the appropriate portion thereof. However, the County shall retain the general administrative cost portion of the fee to cover the cost of the administration of the impact fee calculation, collection and refund. The feepayer must submit an application for such refund to the Director of the Department of Planning and Zoning within thirty (30) days of notification of any of the enumerated circumstances. No refund shall be provided for impact fees deemed expended pursuant to Section 33I-11(c) if no timely claim was made. Funds shall be deemed expended for the purposes of this chapter when a contract or agreement encumbering all or a portion of the payment of said funds shall be approved by final County action. No refunds of police services impact fees shall be given for proposed development activity which results in a negative impact fee computation.</section><section prefix='(b)'>Any impact fee trust funds not expended by the end of the fiscal quarter immediately following six (6) years from the date that the fee was paid shall be returned to the feepayer by the Director of the Department of Planning and Zoning with accrued interest; provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply to developments of regional impact with phased or long term buildout.</section><section prefix='(c)'>If no claim is made within the time period prescribed by this chapter for the money eligible for refund, then said money shall be returned to the appropriate trust fund described in Section 33I-10 and shall be utilized for the purposes described in Section 33I-11. For the purpose of refunds under this section, monies collected shall be deemed to be spent or encumbered for expenditure on the assumption that the first money placed in the appropriate trust fund shall be the first money taken out of the fund when withdrawals are made.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
