<text><section>Sec. 15-3. Prima facie evidence of accumulation of solid waste.<section>The fact that any residential unit or any commercial or multi-family residential establishment located in any County solid waste collection service area is occupied shall be prima facie evidence that solid waste is being produced or accumulated upon such premises. However, temporary residential vacancy, regardless of duration, shall not authorize a refund or excuse the nonpayment of any solid waste fee. Solid waste fees shall be chargeable on new residential units immediately following the Department of Planning, Development and Regulation's final inspection thereof, or installation of permanent electric utility service, or whenever the first solid waste is picked up from such unit by the County, whichever shall occur first.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
