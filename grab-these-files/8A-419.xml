The Program shall provide reference guides to assist businesses in the performance of self-audits.</section><section>After receipt of an application with a completed self-audit, the Program team shall conduct an onsite assessment to confirm the accuracy of the self-audit, which may include requests for the business to provide supporting documentation.
