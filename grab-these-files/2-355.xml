<text><section>Sec. 2-355. Determination by Board of necessity of water contract moratorium; recommendations relating to allocation plant, etc.; period of moratorium.<section>Should the Board of County Commissioners determine that a water contract moratorium is reasonably necessary, it shall order the same and direct that no further water contracts be entered into by either the public or private utility involved or the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Authority. The Board's order shall fix a time within which the County Manager shall report back to the Board with his recommendations relating to an allocation plan for existing water resources and/or a plan to provide more water to the affected area consistent with the Comprehensive Development Plan for Miami-Dade County, Florida. The said time limitation shall be a reasonable one, predicated upon the time needed for a comprehensive analysis of the affected area. The initial Commission moratorium shall be for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days. The Commission on its own motion or otherwise may continue any moratorium for a longer period of time if reasonably necessary. This provision is supplemental to hereof.</section></section></text><history>(Ord. No. 75-31, ยง 6, 5-7-75; Ord. No. 83-92, ยง 4, 10-4-83)</history></law>
