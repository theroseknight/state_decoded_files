<text><section>Sec. 33-284.15. Common open space.<section>Common open space shall be defined as a parcel or parcels of exterior surface area. Said open space shall be required for both residential and commercial development as provided herein. The following uses shall be considered as common open space: Landscaped green areas, water areas, specific areas within enclosed or unenclosed malls that are landscaped with grass, trees and shrubbery, water areas therein, and areas with permanent art display, swimming pools and accessory buildings related to active or passive recreational uses. Roof decks and other outdoor above-grade surfaces may count towards the common open space requirements provided that such spaces are landscaped and developed for outdoor living. A combination of shaded sitting areas, landscaped and garden areas and grassed areas shall be considered as appropriate roof deck development. Tennis courts, swimming pools and other active recreational areas developed on above-grade surfaces may count towards the common open space requirements; provided, however, that an equal amount of above-grade surfaces are extensively landscaped.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
