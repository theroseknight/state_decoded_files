<text><section>Sec. 33-284.17. Common ownership provisions.<section>Provisions shall be made to assure that all nonpublic areas and facilities for the common or joint use of all residents shall be maintained in a continuous and satisfactory manner and without expense to the general taxpayers of Miami-Dade County. Such may be provided by the requirements of home association memberships for the purpose of holding title to such areas and facilities, and levying assessments against each individual ownership for the purpose of maintaining such areas and facilities. These areas and facilities shall include, but not be limited to, all commonly owned recreational facilities, open space, off-street parking areas, streets, sidewalks and street lights. Such assessments shall be superior to all other liens which are amortized over a period of not less than ten (10) years. Other methods may be acceptable if they provide for the proper and continuous payment of taxes of common areas and all maintenance costs without expense to the general taxpayers. The instrument incorporating such provisions shall be approved by the County Attorney as to form and legal sufficiency before submission to the Community Zoning Appeals Board and after approval shall be recorded in the public records of Miami-Dade County.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
