<text><section>Sec. 5-22. Dangerous dogs; authority to designate dog as dangerous; confiscation; appeal procedures.<section prefix='(a)'>Legislative Intent. This section and Section 5-23 are intended to utilize the authority and powers of Miami-Dade County in order to secure for the citizens of this County the protection of their health, safety and welfare. It is intended to be applicable to dangerous dogs, which are defined herein. This section is designed to identify and regulate these dangerous dogs and to ensure responsible handling by their owners through confinement, registration, and liability insurance.
