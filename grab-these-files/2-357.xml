After said public hearing the Board shall make its determination as to whether existing allocations of water resources shall remain the same or shall be changed and/or what actions, if any, can and should be taken to increase these water resources. Should the Board determine that the allocation of water resources shall remain the same, it shall immediately issue its order terminating the water contract moratorium or any part thereof. Should the Board determine that the allocation of existing and future water resources should be changed, or new sources of supply created therefor, it shall issue its order continuing the water contract moratorium or any part thereof and shall immediately take the actions required elsewhere within the Miami-Dade County Code or Charter for such changes.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
