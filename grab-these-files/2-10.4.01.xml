After proposal advertisement, or other formal public notice, the established subconsultant goal may be reduced only with the approval of the County Commission or Public Health Trust.<section>Proposal documents shall require proposers to submit a Letter of Agreement, or equivalent, for each subconsultant to be utilized in satisfaction of a subconsultant goal. The Letter of Agreement, or equivalent, shall be signed by the prime and the subconsultant and shall at a minimum state the type of work that the subconsultant will perform, the technical certification category, and the percentage that the amount of the fees payable to the subconsultant bears to the overall fees payable under the contract.

Failure of a proposer to cure the immaterial irregularities within the stated period following notification shall result in disqualification of the proposer for contract award.</section><section>Proposal documents shall include documentation demonstrating the basis for the subconsultant goal established in the contract.
