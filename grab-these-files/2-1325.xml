<text><section>Sec. 2-1325. Professional certification.<section prefix='(a)'>General. The Department shall have a professional certification permitting process as specifically allowed by the law of the State of Florida and subject to the terms and conditions of this Section. The expedited process set forth in this section shall be used at the option of the owner of the project and the applicant for permits for construction of structures within unincorporated Dade County. This expedited permitting process shall be an alternative to the permit process involving plans review and inspections by the Building Department, and is not intended to affect the permit review, approval and inspection process which may be performed by operation of this Code by other County departments, including, but not limited to the Department of Environmental Resources Management, Planning and Zoning, Fire, Water and Sewer or Public Works. Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair any review mandated by Federal or State law. Participation in the professional certification program shall not relieve the owner, design professional or contractor from any of their respective responsibilities for conformance with the Building Code. No approval or certification by a Responsible Person shall be deemed a waiver of any of the requirements of the Building Code. Municipalities may at their option adopt the provisions of this section through enactments of their governing authorities, whereupon they shall be entitled to participate in the registration process set forth below.</section><section prefix='(b)'>Applicability. For the period of one hundred and eighty (180) days following the effective date of this article, this section shall govern applications for permits for new construction, additions and alterations of commercial structures contained within Building Code Occupancy Groups A, B, E, F, H, I, M and S. All Building Code occupancies will be governed by this Section commencing one hundred and eighty (180) days following its effective date.</section><section prefix='(c)'>Registration. Architects and engineers who wish to participate in the voluntary professional certification program established by this Section shall register with the Office of Code Compliance of Miami-Dade County under their specific discipline. As a condition of registration, architects and engineers shall provide to the Chief Building Code Compliance Officer, in forms to be developed for this purpose, proof of the following:<section prefix='(1)'>Active license as an architect under Part I of Chapter 481 of the Florida Statutes or as an engineer under chapter 471 of the Florida Statutes; and</section><section prefix='(2)'>Professional errors and omissions insurance, with coverage not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence for residential construction and $2,000,000 per occurrence for commercial construction. The insurance policy shall have no deductible, except that the Board of County Commissioners may by resolution allow for a deductible as deemed necessary or advisable for the implementation of the program.</section></section><section>A person registered in this manner shall be referred to in this Section as a Registered Person. The Chief Building Code Compliance Officer shall maintain records of Registered Persons for each discipline and shall update such records, as required, in the event that the registration is suspended or revoked pursuant to the operation of this Section, or in the event that the Registered Person loses his or her qualifications to be so registered. In addition, the Chief Building Code Compliance Officer shall maintain records of individuals performing plans examination and inspections under this program and of such person's license and authorization to perform those services, including certification or exemption under Chapter 468 of the Florida Statutes.</section><section prefix='(d)'>Application. The permit applicant under the expedited process must submit:<section prefix='(1)'>Two completed sets of plans required for the work. The plans must be complete, and in accordance with all applicable codes including without limitation all laws, rules and regulations relating to building, zoning, planning, fire safety, access to the disabled, environmental protection, water and sewer and public works.</section><section prefix='(2)'>Completed verification forms to be developed by the Building Department pursuant to Administrative Order, where the permit applicant makes a notation of Yes (Y) to indicate whether the item has been fulfilled, and where applicable (E) to indicate that the applicant is exempt from the requirement. The verification form shall identify the individuals who performed plans examination and who will be responsible for performing inspections in connection with the work and the disciplines they represent, and shall submit proof of authorization to perform those services. The verification shall also contain an acknowledgment by the permit applicant and the property owner that he or she has opted for the professional certification of plans and inspections provided for in this section, and disclosure language substantially as follows:<section>I have opted to participate in the professional certification program made available to me by operation of State law and County ordinance. I understand that under this optional program, the Building Official for Miami-Dade will not review the plans submitted or perform the code inspections, subject only to a quality assurance program established by law. Instead, plans review and inspections will be performed through licensed personnel of my choosing. The law requires minimum insurance requirements for such licensed personnel, but I understand that I may require more insurance to protect my interests. By executing this form I acknowledge that I have made inquiry regarding the competence of the licensed personnel and the levels of their insurance and am satisfied that my interests are adequately protected.</section></section><section prefix='(3)'>Any required supporting documentation specifically identified in the verification form.</section><section prefix='(4)'>An affidavit or affidavits duly executed by a Registered Person, under his/her specific discipline certifying, to the extent required by the Florida Building Code, the following:<section prefix='(i)'>The plans submitted conform to the technical codes, including the Building Code. The plans conform to the laws as to egress, type of construction and general arrangement and show the structural design. The plans and design conform to the requirements of the building codes as to strength, stresses, strains, loads and stability.</section><section prefix='(ii)'>The plans review was performed by the individuals identified in the permit application form who are duly authorized by law to perform those duties.</section><section prefix='(iii)'>The inspection duties will be performed by the individuals identified in the permit application who are duly authorized to perform those duties.</section></section><section prefix='(5)'>For threshold buildings, the structural inspection plan required in accordance with Section 553.79 of the Florida Statutes.

The design professional who signed and sealed the plans shall not serve as the Registered Person for the construction. A person who holds a financial interest in the construction shall not be authorized to serve as Registered Person. For these purposes, a partner, employee, or shareholder of a developer, owner or contractor submitting the permit application or a participant in a design-build team together with a contractor submitting the application shall be deemed to hold a financial interest in the construction.</section></section><section prefix='(6)'>All applicable fees, including a permit fee to be established by administrative order which shall be used to defray the cost of clerical review of the application for completeness and the cost of the quality control system established pursuant to this Section.</section></section><section prefix='(e)'>Review of application.

Upon such cancellation, the permit applicant may file a new permit application which shall be treated as an application for a new permit, subject to all applicable requirements for fees, plans review, examination and inspection. Applicants may also request in writing, in forms to be developed for this purpose, the interpretation or reconsideration of an issue related to the Building Code or technical codes in advance of filing the application. Such interpretation may be rendered by the responsible official, in writing, and a copy of the same will become part of the application.
