No. 92-20, adopted March 17, 1992, has been used. The section numbers assigned in the 1957 Code have been retained so that sections of this Code are also sections of the 1957 Code. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.</section><section></section><section>The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of is numbered 1-2 and the first section of is. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3, respectively. If new material is to be included between Chapters and, it will be designated as Chapter 12A. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the new article or division.</section><section></section><section>The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.</section><section></section><section>A special feature of this publication to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date periodically. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.</section><section>Successfully keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.</section><section></section><section>This publication was under the direct supervision of the editoral staff of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.</section><section>The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Dianne S. Smith, Assistant County Attorney, and Mr. Raymond Reed, Deputy Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.</section><section>MUNICIPAL CODE CORPORATION</section><section>Tallahassee, Florida</section><section>ORDINANCE NO. 59-41</section><section></section><section>WHEREAS, Section 11 of Article VIII of the Florida Constitution provides that the Home Rule Charter of Government for Dade County, Florida, may grant full power and authority to the Board of County Commissioners to pass ordinances relating to the affairs, property and government of Dade County and to provide suitable penalties for the violation thereof, and to do everything necessary to carry on a central metropolitan government in Dade County; and</section><section>WHEREAS,(H) of the Home Rule Charter provides that, within two years after adoption of the Charter, the County Commission shall have prepared a general codification of all County ordinances and resolutions having the effect of law, and that such general codification shall be adopted by the County Commission in a single ordinance; and that after adoption the County Commission shall have the codification printed immediately in an appropriate manner, together with the Charter, and such rules and regulations as the County Commission may direct.</section><section></section><section>Section 1.
