<text><section>Sec. 21-22.1. Sale, offer for sale, purchase with intent to sell and public display for sale prohibited of synthetic stimulant bath salts, synthetic cathinones, synthetic amphetamines and other synthetic stimulants that mimic illegal drugs.<section prefix='(a)'>Purpose and intent. The Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners finds and declares that the products and synthetic substances described hereunder are commonly used as alternatives to amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy and other illegal drugs. The Board further finds that these synthetic substances are particularly appealing to youth, and that these synthetic substances are potentially dangerous to users in the short term and the long term effects are not yet known. The Board finds that the products which contain these synthetic substances often use a disclaimer that the product is "not for human consumption" to avoid regulations that require the manufacturer to list the product's active ingredients. The Board finds that drug designers and chemists can quickly create new synthetic drugs once federal or state law makes a particular synthetic drug illegal. As such, the Board finds there is a need to declare illegal the sale, offer for sale, purchase with intent to sell and public display for sale of synthetic substances that mimic illegal controlled substances, even though such synthetic substances have not yet themselves been categorized as illegal controlled substances under federal or state law. The Board further finds that it is proper and necessary for the Board to exercise its authority to safeguard and protect the public health, safety and welfare by taking this action.</section><section prefix='(b)'>Application.
