<text><section>Sec. 31-611. Suspension and revocation proceedings.<section prefix='(a)'>Grounds for suspension or revocation. In addition to the grounds for automatic suspension or revocation provided elsewhere in this chapter, for-hire licenses, operating permits, and chauffeur registrations shall be subject to suspension or revocation by the Director as follows:<section prefix='(1)'>Upon the Director's determination that:<section prefix='(i)'>The license, registration, or permit holder has pled nolo contendere, pled guilty, been found guilty, or been convicted (regardless of whether adjudication has been withheld) of any criminal offense which would preclude the issuance of the license, registration, or permit as provided in this chapter;</section><section prefix='(ii)'>The license, registration, or permit was obtained by an application in which any material fact was omitted or falsely stated;</section><section prefix='(iii)'>The license, registration, or permit holder has failed to comply with or has violated any of the provisions of this chapter;</section><section prefix='(iv)'>The public interest will best be served by revocation, or suspension of the license, registration, or permit; provided, however, that good cause be shown;</section><section prefix='(v)'>The chauffeur has failed any drug test required by the Code or state or federal law; or</section><section prefix='(vi)'>Any for-hire limousine has been operated in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter.</section></section></section><section prefix='(b)'>Notice of suspension or revocation action.

The notice of appeal shall set forth concisely the nature of the decision appealed and the reasons or grounds for appeal.</section><section prefix='(3)'>Failure to appeal. Failure to appeal the decision of the Director within the prescribed time period shall constitute a waiver of the person's right to an administrative hearing before the hearing officer. Where the Director's decision involves a suspension or revocation, a waiver of the right to an administrative hearing shall be treated as an admission of the violation and the Director's decision shall be deemed final and enforceable. No further remedies shall be granted and the decision shall stand.</section><section prefix='(4)'>Hearing officers. Hearing Officers shall be appointed by the Clerk of the Courts, Code Enforcement Section.</section><section prefix='(5)'>Scheduling and conduct of hearing.<section prefix='(a)'>Upon receipt of a timely request for an administrative hearing, the hearing officer shall set the matter down for hearing on the next regularly scheduled hearing date or as soon as possible thereafter or as mandated in the specified section of the Code.</section><section prefix='(b)'>The hearing officer shall send a notice of hearing by first class mail to the named party at his, her or its last known address.

Based upon this fact-finding determination, the hearing officer shall either affirm or reverse the decision of the Director. If the hearing officer affirms the decision of the Director, the named party shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of the hearing officer's decision to comply with the decision of the Director. If the hearing officer reverses the decision of the Director and finds (1) the named party not responsible for the violation alleged; or (2) insufficient basis for the denial of application, a written decision shall be prepared setting forth the basis for such determination.

The enforcement procedures outlined herein are cumulative to all others and shall not be deemed to be prerequisites to filing suit for the enforcement of any section of this Code. The words "action" and "decision" as used herein shall not include the filing of any action by the director in any court.
