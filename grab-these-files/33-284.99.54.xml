<text><section>Sec. 33-284.99.54. Non-conforming Structures, Uses, and Occupancies.<section>Nothing contained in this article shall be deemed or construed to prohibit a continuation of a legal nonconforming structure, use, or occupancy in the NCUAD that either (1) was existing as of the date of the district boundary change on the property to NCUAD or (2) on or before said date, had received final site plan approval through a public hearing pursuant to this chapter or through administrative site plan review or had a valid building permit. However, any structure, use, or occupancy in the NCUAD that is discontinued for a period of at least six months, or is superseded by a lawful structure, use, or occupancy permitted under this chapter, or that incurs damage to an extent of 50 percent or more of its market value, shall be subject to(c) of this code. It is further provided, however, that no lawfully existing single-family home use or mobile home park use shall be subject to(c) of this code, even if it is discontinued for a period of six months or more or incurs damage to the roof or structure to an extent of 50 percent or more of its market value.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
