<text><section>Sec. 10-9. Same—Special standards.<section prefix='(a)'>Special standards or kinds of examination for particular trades or specialties may be established by the directors, but such special standards or kinds of examination shall not be effective unless and until approved by the County Commission.</section><section prefix='(b)'>Additional specialty contractors classifications requiring written examinations may be established, or existing specialty contractors classifications abolished by approval of the Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners after recommendation of the Board defining the classification and scope of work thereof and all applicants within a particular class, trade or specialty shall receive equal treatment.</section><section prefix='(c)'>Because of the possibility of this chapter failing to cover many uncontemplated classifications of specialty contractors, the Board may, without further approval of the Board of County Commissioners, provide additional classifications of specialty contractors that do not need such technical knowledge as to require either written or oral examination in order to determine their proficiency in the craft concerned. The Board shall define such classification and scope of work thereof. Such a contractor shall have a qualifying agent that meets the reasonable standards and qualifications as prescribed by the Board at the time the board establishes such a classification and such reasonable standards and qualifications shall be based upon experience in the craft or trade. The Board may redefine and change or modify the type of work for such established unexamined classifications and abolish the same as experience with such a previously established classification may justify.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
