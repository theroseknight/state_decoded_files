<text><section>Sec. 2-340. Declaration of legislative intent.<section>The Board of County Commissioners hereby declares it to be the policy of Miami-Dade County to establish, own and operate a Countywide sanitary sewage collection and disposal system and water supply, treatment and distribution system. The Board finds that in order to best administer a Countywide water and sewer service within the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade County with the ability effectively to provide for water and sewer services in conjunction with the growth and expansion needs of Miami-Dade County, it is necessary that the administration and policies of said agency be closely coordinated with the overall County plans and programs for growth and development. It is the further intent of this Board that the most effective method of implementing the foregoing policies and considerations is by creating a Countywide Water and Sewer Department to be administered under policy determinations of the Board of County Commissioners and the supervision of the County Manager through a Director of the Water and Sewer Department acting with the advice and assistance of a Water and Sewer Advisory Board.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
