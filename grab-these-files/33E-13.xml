<text><section>Sec. 33E-13. Refund of impact fees paid.<section prefix='(a)'>If a building permit encompassing feepaying development expires or is revoked, the feepayer shall, upon submission of a written request to the County Planning and Zoning Director, be entitled to a refund of the impact fee paid except that the county shall retain the general administrative cost portion of the fee to cover the cost of the administration of the impact fee calculation, collection and refund. However, no refund shall be provided for impact fees deemed expended pursuant to Section 33E-13(b) or for the cost of completed improvements contributed in-lieu-of-fee.</section><section prefix='(b)'>Any fee trust funds not expended by the end of the fiscal quarter immediately following six (6) years from the date the fee was paid shall be returned to the feepayer by the County Planning and Zoning Director with accrued interest. Funds shall be expended in the order in which they are collected and shall be deemed expended for purposes of this chapter when a road contract or agreement obligating all or a portion of the payment of said funds shall be approved by Miami-Dade County. The impact fee manual shall set forth a procedure to be used for identifying the source of monies expended. The feepayer shall be required to submit a written request for refund to the County Planning and Zoning Director before issuance of the refund can be authorized. No refunds of road impact fees will be provided for in the event the feepayer does not request such a refund prior to the expiration of one (1) year following the six-year period from the date the road impact fee was paid.</section><section prefix='(c)'>The feepayer may request a refund of road impact fees paid for a development that has been exempted pursuant to Section 33E-14. The amount of the exemption refund shall exclude the administrative cost portion of the fee. Application must be made within one (1) year of the issuance of a certificate of completion or a certificate of occupancy for the subject of the exemption and shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the road impact fee manual.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
