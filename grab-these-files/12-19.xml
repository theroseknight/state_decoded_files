<text><section>Sec. 12-19. Penalties.<section>In addition to any other penalties which may be applicable, any individual who violates this ordinance shall be subject to a fine up to fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for the first three (3) days late and, thereafter, five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each day late, not to exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total receipts or expenditures, whichever is greater, for the period covered by the late report. If it is determined by a court which has jurisdiction over an alleged violation of the ordinance from which this section derives that unusual circumstances caused the Campaign Treasurer's Report to be filed late, no fine shall be imposed by the court. As used herein, "unusual circumstances" shall mean uncommon, rare or sudden events over which the actor has no control and which directly result in the failure to act according to the filing requirements. Unusual circumstances must occur within a time period that would clearly prevent the person legally responsible for filing the report from doing so in a timely manner.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
