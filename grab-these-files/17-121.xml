<text><section>Sec. 17-121. Title; purpose.<section>This article shall be entitled, "The Infill Housing Initiative." Its purpose is to increase the availability of affordable homes for low and moderate income persons, maintain a stock of affordable housing, redevelop urban neighborhoods by eliminating the blight of vacant lots and dilapidated or abandoned properties, to equitably distribute homeownership opportunities within the Infill Target Areas, and generate payment of ad valorem taxes. The Infill Housing Initiative shall encourage the redevelopment of vacant, dilapidated or abandoned property through the sale or transfer of County property to qualified developers and the inclusion of privately owned vacant, dilapidated or abandoned properties. The community development corporations and developers shall be required to build affordable single-family homes to be sold to low and moderate income households. Although the Infill Housing Initiative is primarily designed to create affordable homeownership of single-family homes, the County under limited circumstances may at its sole discretion permit developers to rent these homes to qualified low or moderate income families.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
