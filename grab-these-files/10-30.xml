<text><section>Sec. 10-30. Annual revision of pro rata formula.<section>In order to provide for an annual revision of the pro rata distribution formula each participating municipality shall maintain a contractors register, which shall include the names of all contractors who do business in the municipality during the license year, which shall be from October 1 through September 30 of the following year, the type of each contractor and their respective certificate of competency numbers. At the end of each license year, each participating municipality shall deliver such register to the County Manager, who shall revise the pro rata distribution formula by calculating the amount of fees each participating municipality would have collected under its 1963-64 fee schedule, based on the number and type of contractors listed in the respective registers. Upon arriving at such total figure for each participating municipality, the licenses issued for the individual municipality shall be deducted and a new pro rata share for each municipality will be arrived at by calculating the percentage such individual municipality's total is to the overall total fees which would have been collected by all participating municipalities under their respective 1963-64 fee schedules and the distribution for the coming license year shall be based on such percentage figures.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
