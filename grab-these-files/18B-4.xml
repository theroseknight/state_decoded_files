Minimum standards.<section prefix='(A)'>Irrigation.<section prefix='(1)'>All newly-planted and relocated plant material shall be watered by temporary or permanent irrigation systems until such time as they are established and subsequently on as needed basis to prevent stress and die-off in compliance with existing water use restrictions.</section><section prefix='(2)'>Irrigation systems shall be prohibited within native plant communities and natural forest communities, except for temporary systems needed to establish newly planted material. Temporary irrigation systems shall be disconnected immediately after establishment of plant communities.</section><section prefix='(3)'>Irrigation systems shall be designed, operated and maintained to:<section prefix='(a)'>Meet the needs of the plants in the landscape.</section><section prefix='(b)'>Conserve water by allowing differential operation schedules based on hydrozone.</section><section prefix='(c)'>Consider soil, slope and other site characteristics in order to minimize water waste, including overspray or overflow on to impervious surfaces and other non-vegetated areas, and off-site runoff.</section><section prefix='(d)'>Minimize free flow conditions in case of damage or other mechanical failure.</section><section prefix='(e)'>Use low trajectory spray heads, and/or low volume water distributing or application devices.</section><section prefix='(f)'>Maximize uniformity, considering factors such as:<section prefix='1.'>Emitters types,</section><section prefix='2.'>Head spacing,</section><section prefix='3.'>Sprinkler pattern, and</section><section prefix='4.'>Water pressure at the emitter.</section></section><section prefix='(g)'>Use the lowest quality water feasible (graywater shall be used where approved systems are available).</section><section prefix='(h)'>Rain switches or other devices, such as soil moisture sensors, shall be used with automatic controls.</section><section prefix='(i)'>Operate only during hours and on days permitted under Chapter 32 of this Code.</section><section prefix='(j)'>Where feasible, drip irrigation or micro-sprinklers shall be used.</section></section><section prefix='(4)'>During dry periods, irrigation application rates of between one (1) and one and one-half (1½) inches per week are recommended for turf areas.</section></section><section prefix='(B)'>Plant material and mulch.<section prefix='(1)'>At least fifty (50) percent of the plant material shall be low maintenance and drought tolerant.

Plants with similar water needs shall be grouped in hydrozones. Adequate growth area (including rooting space), based on natural mature shape and size shall be provided for all plant materials.</section><section prefix='(7)'>Trees and shrubs shall be planted in the energy conservation zone where feasible, in order to reduce energy consumption by shading buildings and other structures and shall be used to reduce heat island effects by shading paved surfaces.</section><section prefix='(8)'>Street trees shall be used to shade roadways and provide visual order. Where feasible, selected species shall be used to establish a road hierarchy by defining different road types.</section><section prefix='(9)'>Prohibited trees shall be removed.</section><section prefix='(10)'>Special attention shall be given to the use of appropriate species located under, or adjacent to overhead power lines, and near native plant communities and near underground utility lines.
