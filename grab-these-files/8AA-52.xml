<text><section>Sec. 8AA-52. Records and reporting requirements; access to records.<section>The County shall have access, at all reasonable hours, to books, records, maps, plans, contracts, engineering, accounting, financial, statistical, subscriber and service records relating to the property and operation of the licensee's Miami-Dade County system and to such other records as may be required by the County to perform its regulatory responsibilities under this chapter and the calculation of gross revenues used to compute license fees. Such records shall be made available upon reasonable notice at the licensee's local Miami-Dade County office. If the licensee shall fail to obtain books or records not kept in the local office, and if the County shall determine that an examination of such records is necessary or appropriate to the performance of any of the County's duties, then all travel and maintenance expenses necessarily incurred in making such examination shall be paid by the licensee. The County shall have the right to inspect and audit such records as it deems appropriate for the proper administration of this chapter. The County may photocopy records only to the extent that it can protect proprietary information from disclosure under the public records law.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
