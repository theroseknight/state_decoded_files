At the time of qualifying candidates shall submit proof of residency for the prescribed period to the supervisor of elections. Proof of residency shall establish that the qualifying candidate has met the residency requirements for the required period. Any person misrepresenting their residency shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment not to exceed sixty (60) days in the County jail or both, at the discretion of the court. No Council Member shall be employed by Miami-Dade County or be a member of the County Commission.</section><section prefix='(2)'>The term of office of Community Council members shall be for four (4) years. It is provided, however, that when a Community Council has been modified to establish new subareas or at large areas, in the initial election of Council Members, those members representing even-numbered subareas shall serve a two-year term and those members representing odd-numbered subareas or at large areas shall serve a four-year term so as to create staggered terms. Thereafter all Council Members shall serve four-year terms. When a subarea is dissolved and is replaced by an at large area, the at large representative shall serve until expiration of the term of office that was provided for the dissolved subarea. It is further provided that when a Community Council consisting of one (1) subarea is created in the initial election three (3) seats shall be designated as two-year terms and three (3) seats shall be designated as four-year terms so as to provide staggered terms. Thereafter, all Council members shall serve four-year terms.</section><section prefix='(3)'>All elections for Community Council Members shall be non-partisan. The initial general election for Council Members shall be held at the time of the 1996 General Election. Subsequent elections of Council Members shall be held in each even numbered year, in conjunction with state primary elections.

It is provided, however, where the number of persons qualifying for a Community Council election is equal to the number of positions both for expired and unexpired terms the candidates filling the unexpired terms shall be determined by lot.</section></section></section><section prefix='(7)'>Vacancies. The County Commissioner whose district encompasses the greatest total population within the Community Council area, based on population data from the decennial Census, shall fill any vacant Council positions, by the appointment of an individual meeting the qualifications provided in subsection (1) above from a list of one or more names supplied by the Community Council.

In the event any Council Member no longer resides in a Council subarea for a subarea position or Council area for an at large position, that person shall be deemed to have tendered their resignation from such Council; provided, however, any Council Member who, as a result of a modification to the configuration of a Council subarea pursuant to Section 20-42, is no longer qualified to be an elected member of such Council, shall be permitted to complete the term of office commenced prior to the subarea boundary modification.</section><section prefix='(B)'>Appointed Council Members.<section prefix='(1)'>The County Commissioners shall appoint one (1) member to each Community Council following each election of Council Members.
