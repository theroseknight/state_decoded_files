<text><section>Sec. 17-42. Legislative findings.<section>The County Commission hereby finds and declares that there presently exist in the City of Miami, Florida, structures used for human habitation which are, or may become in the future, substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance. Further, that such conditions, together with inadequate provisions for light and air, insufficient protection against fire hazards, lack of proper ventilation for heating and cooling, unsanitary conditions, and overcrowding, constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, welfare, and reasonable comfort of the citizens and visitors of this municipality. It is further found and declared that the existence of such conditions, factors, or characteristics, if not remedied, will create slum areas requiring large scale clearance, and further that, in the absence of corrective measures, such areas will experience a deterioration of social values, a curtailment of investment and tax revenues, and impairment of economic values. It is further found and declared that the establishment and maintenance of minimum housing standards are essential to the prevention of blight and decay, and the safeguarding of public health, safety, morals and welfare.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
