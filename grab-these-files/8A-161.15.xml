<text><section>Sec. 8A-161.15. Written analysis.<section>Upon the request of any customer, all motor vehicle repair shops shall provide a written analysis, based upon diagnostic testing, to the customer, in addition to the written estimate, prior to performing any repair work for the customer. Such written analysis shall also include the length of time necessary for such repair. In the event that the motor vehicle is not repaired within the time specified in the written analysis, the motor vehicle repair shop shall provide in writing a new analysis as to the time necessary to complete the repairs. The motor vehicle customer must give written approval for such extension or the vehicle must be returned to the customer within 48 hours from the disapproval of such extension. The customer may require that, in lieu of the above, a summary of the results of the aforesaid written analysis be communicated to the customer by fax, telephone, mail, telegram, or orally, with personal delivery of the complete written analysis to occur at a later time of the customer's choosing. The customer may, in writing, waive the requirements of this section. No motor vehicle repair shop shall solicit or demand a waiver of any customer's rights herein enumerated as a pre-condition to acceptance of repair work.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
