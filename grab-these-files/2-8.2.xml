In all cases where a performance or payment bond is not provided, the following procedures shall be followed:<section prefix='(i)'>At any time prior to final completion of a contract exempted from bond requirements, the County shall not authorize or make payment to the contractor in excess of seventy-five (75) percent of the amount due on the contract on the basis of the work suitably completed and material suitably stored on the site.</section><section prefix='(ii)'>In case of default by the contractor, the laborers, materialmen, and subcontractors, as defined in Section 713.01 Florida Statutes, making claims for unpaid bills, will be paid from the twenty-five (25) percent retainage on a pro rata basis as follows:<section prefix='A.'>The sum of all claims made shall be divided into each individual claim thereby deriving a percentage value for each claim. The total retainage will then be multiplied by the percentage value and the result shall be the pro rata share of the retainage to be paid to the claimant; however the payment shall not be more than the claim.</section></section><section prefix='(iii)'>The final payment of retainage shall not be made until the project has been inspected by the architect/engineer or other person designated by the County for that purpose and until he or she has issued a written certificate that the project has been constructed in accordance with the approved plans, specifications and approved change orders and until the County has accepted the project, and until the contractor has supplied the County with signed and dated statements from all laborers, materialmen, and subcontractors as defined in Section 713.01 Florida Statutes and identified under (v) hereinafter, that they have no claims against the contractor for the work under the contract. Said statements shall identify the project by name and project number.</section><section prefix='(iv)'>The contractor shall provide evidence in the form of certified copies, that it has placed a notice in the following form, on three (3) occasions, in a local newspaper and has posted such notice in a conspicuous place on the project site.<section>"Notice is hereby made to all those concerned and affected that (CONTRACTOR'S NAME) is performing (PROJECT NAME), (PROJECT NUMBER) at (LOCATION).

This list shall be updated thereafter each month with a certified statement that the list and its updates include the names and addresses of all of those subcontractors, laborers, and material suppliers furnishing labor and/or material for the project.</section><section prefix='(vi)'>The contractor shall provide a written statement with each pay request to the County which indicates how each payment requested will be distributed. This pay request breakdown shall define the disbursement intended for all of the funds requested.</section><section prefix='(vii)'>When a contractor receives any payment from the County, it shall pay such moneys received to each subcontractor and material supplier in proportion to the percentage of work completed by each subcontractor and supplier at the time of receipt of the payment. If the contractor receives less than full payment, then the contractor shall be required to disburse only the funds received on a pro rata basis with the contractor, subcontractors, and suppliers, each receiving a prorated portion based on the amount due on the payment. If the contractor without reasonable cause fails to make payments required by this section to subcontractors and suppliers within thirty (30) days after the receipt of billing by the subcontractors and suppliers, the contractor shall pay to the subcontractors and suppliers a penalty in the amount of one-half of one (1) percent of the amount due, per day, from the expiration of the period allowed herein for payment.

In instances where there are two (2) available BBEs, the Commission or Trust may apply a subcontractor or project goal where no BBE has participated as a subcontractor to a prime contractor having a contract with the County for the goods or services advertised within the preceding eighteen (18) months. Further, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section of the Code, where a subcontractor or project goal is applied when only two (2) BBEs are available, a bidder who fails to meet the goal may remain eligible for award if the bidder submits written evidence within two (2) business days from bid submission that the prices submitted by BBEs to the bidder were not reasonable compared to those submitted to the bidder by other non-BBE subcontractors. A BBE's bid will be considered reasonably competitive if its bid, for the same scope of work, is within 25 percent of the bid of comparably-sized non-BBE firms. After bid advertisement or other formal public notice, the established subcontractor or project goal may be reduced only with the approval of the County Commission or Public Health Trust.</section><section prefix='b.'>Bid documents shall require bidders to submit a form at the time of bid submission identifying all BBEs to be utilized to meet the subcontractor goals, the scope of work each will perform, including the goods or services each will provide, and the dollar value of such work. In order to assure at the time of bid submission agreement upon the above information between the bidder and the BBE, bid documents shall also require bidders to submit a form no later than two (2) business days after bid submission confirming such information through signed documents from the BBEs involved. Failure to submit the required forms at the specified time shall render the bid non-responsive. Submission of a defective form shall render the bid voidable.</section><section prefix='c.'>In contracts with subcontractor or project goals for Women and Hispanic business enterprises, a BBE certified as a Women or Hispanic business enterprise shall be counted towards meeting the goal for one category only. The prime bidder shall declare at bid submission toward which subcontractor goal a business enterprise certified in more than one category shall count.</section><section prefix='d.'>Bidders whose bids fail to meet a subcontractor goal, in order to remain eligible for award of the contract, must submit evidence, no later than two (2) business days after bid submission, proving enterprises in any category for which a goal is established are not available to afford effective competition in providing goods or services under the contract to meet the goal. Inability of a BBE to obtain bonding at the bidder's request may not be sufficient proof of such BBE's lack of availability.</section><section prefix='e.'>A successful bidder that is a BBE or a joint venture owned and controlled by a BBE may comply with up to one-half (½) of a subcontractor goal set for the contract by performing work with its own forces.</section><section prefix='f.'>Bid documents shall provide that expenditures to subcontracting joint ventures shall be counted toward meeting specified goals only when such joint ventures are owned and controlled by at least one BBE.</section><section prefix='g.'>Bid documents shall provide that (i) only expenditures to subcontracting BBEs for performing a commercially useful function shall be counted toward meeting a subcontractor goal, (ii) expenditures to subcontracting BBEs for acting essentially as a broker to a non-BBE shall not be counted toward meeting a subcontractor goal, and (iii) expenditures to subcontracting BBEs who subcontract work further to non-BBEs shall not be counted toward meeting a specified goal unless such subcontracting receives prior approval from the Department of Business and Economic Development as consistent with normal industry practice.</section><section prefix='h.'>Bid documents shall allow bidders to challenge or protest a subcontractor or project goal by submitting no later than the time of bid submission the reasons for such challenge or protest in writing to the department responsible for the contract. Such challenges or protests by bidders after the time of bid submission shall not be heard by the County Commission or Public Health Trust.</section></section><section prefix='3.'>Bid preferences:<section prefix='a.'>The County Commission or Public Health Trust may authorize a bid preference on contracts which are to be awarded to the responsive and responsible bidder with the lowest price and which are not set-aside. The bid preference shall be used only to evaluate a bid and shall not affect the contract price.</section><section prefix='b.'>Contracts may give a bid preference in an amount of up to ten (10) percent of the bid price to bidders that:<section prefix='i.'>Are BBEs;</section><section prefix='ii.'>Are joint ventures; or</section><section prefix='iii.'>Demonstrate significant utilization of BBEs in their purchases in Miami-Dade County of goods and services as set forth in bid documents or administrative orders.</section></section><section prefix='c.'>Bidders that significantly utilize BBEs in their purchases in Miami-Dade County of goods or services in order to receive a bid preference, shall list at the time of bid submission or as may otherwise be specified their purchases in Miami-Dade County of goods and services and their utilization of BBEs in such purchases for the twenty-four-month period prior to bid submission. Purchases in Miami-Dade County of goods and services required by any local, state or federal race-conscious measures shall not be recognized for purposes of calculating bid preferences.</section><section prefix='d.'>Joint ventures must be approved prior to bid opening to establish the percentage of BBE participation which will be recognized. The BBE member of the joint venture shall perform work, manage the job and take financial risks in proportion to its level of participation in the joint venture. Agreements establishing joint ventures shall be in writing. Bid and contract documents shall require that the portion of the work to be performed by the BBE member of the joint venture be set forth in detail separately from the work to be performed by the non-BBE member.</section></section><section prefix='4.'>BBE selection factor. The County Commission or Public Health Trust may authorize the use of a BBE selection factor as one basis for deciding among bids for contracts to be awarded upon criteria in addition to price and not set-aside under Section 2-8.2(3)(c)1.<section prefix='a.'>In bids that assign weights to evaluation or selection criteria, bid documents shall assign a weight of ten (10) percent to the BBE selection factor. In bids that do not assign weights to evaluation or selection criteria, bid documents shall provide that among bidders evaluated to be otherwise substantially equal, the BBE selection factor shall be the deciding factor for award of the bid.</section><section prefix='b.'>Any committee formed to evaluate a bid with a BBE selection factor shall include a voting representative from the Department of Business and Economic Development.</section></section></section><section prefix='(d)'>Review committee. The County Manager shall establish an administrative procedure for the review of each proposed County contract to which this section applies, including the establishment of a committee to recommend whether race-conscious measures provided in Section 2-8.2(3)(c) above should be applied.</section><section prefix='(e)'>Certification.<section prefix='1.'>The County Manager shall implement eligibility criteria and procedures for entities to be certified as BBEs.<section prefix='a.'>Such criteria shall set limits on the size of BBEs based on regulations of the Small Business Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce for "small business concerns," presently codified at 13 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 121, Subpart A.</section><section prefix='b.'>Any BBE that exceeds the size limits established by this subparagraph shall be allowed to retain its certification for one (1) additional year from the date it is formally notified it has exceeded the size limits.</section><section prefix='c.'>Any such BBE may have its certification extended provided the BBE demonstrates that it continues to experience the kinds of racial discrimination addressed by this section.</section></section><section prefix='2.'>The Department of Business and Economic Development shall maintain and publish at least every other week an updated list of BBEs, identifying each listed BBE based on the nature of the goods and/or services the BBE shall be certified to supply.</section><section prefix='3.'>The Department of Business and Economic Development shall not certify an applicant, shall not recertify a BBE, and shall decertify a BBE that fails to comply with the criteria or procedures for obtaining or maintaining certification. The Department of Business and Economic Development shall have authority to suspend the certification of a BBE during any appeal of a decertification decision.</section><section prefix='4.'>Certification shall be renewed annually, and must be in effect at the time of bid submission, bid award, and throughout the duration of the contract. BBEs experiencing changes in ownership shall notify the Department of Business and Economic Development within thirty (30) days of the effective date of such changes.</section><section prefix='5.'>Applicants and certified BBEs must perform a commercially useful function to be eligible for certification or remain certified.</section><section prefix='6.'>A Black individual, alone or as a member or a group, shall be eligible to have a business certified as a BBE only if a Black owner personally possesses the licenses and satisfies the qualifying requirements established by a board regulating the industry in which certification is sought. A BBE certified on the effective date of this ordinance that is unable to meet these requirements shall be allowed to retain its certification for two (2) years from this date.</section><section prefix='7.'>A Black individual, alone or as a member of a group, shall own or control only one BBE at a time and shall not own and control another separate business certified under the Women Business Enterprise or Hispanic Business Enterprise Programs.</section><section prefix='8.'>A Black individual, alone or as a member of a group, and any BBE may not hold more than a twenty-five (25) percent equity ownership in any other BBE in the same or similar line of business. If a non-BBE in the same or similar line of business as an applicant or existing BBE has an equity ownership of such BBE that exceeds twenty-five (25) percent, the applicant or existing BBE shall not be certified. A BBE certified on the effective date of this ordinance that is unable to meet these requirements shall be allowed to retain its certification provided it submits a plan that the Department of Business and Economic Development finds will accomplish within one (1) year of the effective date of this ordinance a bona fide and actual transfer of equity ownership that satisfies these requirements.</section><section prefix='9.'>The Department of Business and Economic Development may require applicants and BBEs to submit information regarding their business operations, including but not limited to a breakdown of the applicant's or BBE workforce as to race, national origin and gender.</section><section prefix='10.'>Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit a Black individual from being certified under the Hispanic Business Enterprise or the Women Business Enterprise Programs.</section></section><section prefix='(f)'>Prompt payment.<section prefix='1.'>The County Manager and the President of the Public Health Trust shall establish administrative procedures requiring that billings from BBEs that have signed contracts with Miami-Dade County or the Public Health Trust be promptly reviewed and payment made on those amounts not in dispute within thirty (30) days of receipt of billing.</section><section prefix='2.'>Contracts with subcontractor goals shall require that billings from BBEs that are under contract with the successful bidder be promptly reviewed and payment made to such BBEs on those amounts not in dispute within thirty (30) days of receipt by the successful bidder of such billings. Such contracts shall include provisions for subcontracting BBEs to grieve intentional, wrongful delays in payment by the successful bidder to the BBE and for penalties and sanctions for such delays, including debarment.</section></section><section prefix='(g)'>Sanctions for contractual violations. Bid and contract documents shall provide that, notwithstanding any other penalties or sanctions provided by law, a bidder's violation of or failure to comply with this section or its implementing administrative orders may result in the imposition of one or more of the following sanctions:<section prefix='1.'>The suspension of any payment or part thereof until such time as the issues concerning compliance are resolved;</section><section prefix='2.'>Work stoppage;</section><section prefix='3.'>Termination, suspension, or cancellation of the contract in whole or part;</section><section prefix='4.'>In the event a bidder or BBE attempts to comply with the provisions of this ordinance through fraud, misrepresentation, or material misstatement, the County shall, whenever practicable, terminate the contract or require the termination or cancellation of the subcontract for the project on which the bidder or BBE committed such acts.
