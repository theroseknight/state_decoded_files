<text><section>Sec. 8AA-77. Force majeure.<section>In the event the licensee's performance of any of the terms and conditions or obligations required by this chapter is prevented by a cause or event not within the licensee's control, such inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof; provided, however, that such inability to perform shall relieve the licensee of its responsibility to provide enhanced credits and rebates pursuant to(e), but shall not relieve a licensee from its general obligations to provide pro rata credits or rebates for interruptions in service. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within the control of the licensee shall include without limitation acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court, explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and fires, but shall not include financial inability of the licensee to perform or failure of the licensee to obtain any necessary permits or licenses from other governmental agencies or the right to use the facilities of any public utility where such failure is due solely to the acts or omissions of the licensee, or the failure of the licensee to secure supplies, services or equipment necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable communications system where the licensee has failed to exercise reasonable diligence to secure such supplies, services or equipment.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
