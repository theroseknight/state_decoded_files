<text><section>Sec. 2-1862. Appropriations to fund.<section>Except for the purpose of funding the Fund pursuant to herein, upon the enactment of this article, each taxing authority shall, by January 1st of each year, appropriate to the Fund for so long as any indebtedness pledging increment revenues to the payment thereof is outstanding but not to exceed thirty (30) years, or for a period not to exceed ten (10) years pending a sunset review by this Board, a sum that is no less than the increment as defined and determined by of this article accruing to such taxing authority. In no year shall the County's obligation to the Fund exceed the amount of that year's tax increment as determined pursuant to of this article. The County's increment contribution is to be accounted for as a separate revenue within the Fund but may be combined within other revenues for the purpose of paying debt service. The County must approve the amount, duration of the obligation and the purpose of any bond, note or other form of indebtedness, including advances, pledging or otherwise obligating tax increment funds.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
