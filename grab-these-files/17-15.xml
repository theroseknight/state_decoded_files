Each day during any portion of which such violation occurs constitutes a separate offense.</section><section prefix='(d)'>The Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer or his assistant, may, in the Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer's or his assistant's discretion, terminate an investigation or an action commenced under the provisions of this article upon execution of a written consent agreement between the Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer or his assistant and the record owner of the land which is the subject of the investigation or action. The consent agreement shall provide written assurance of voluntary compliance with all the applicable provisions of this article by the record owner.

The consent agreement may, in the discretion of the Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer upon agreement of the owner, provide for compensatory damages, punitive damages and civil penalties.
