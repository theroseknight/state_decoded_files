<text><section>Sec. 17A-3. Construction and applicability.<section>The provisions of this chapter and the standards therein shall be applicable to the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Metropolitan Miami-Dade County, Florida. Every portion of a vacant structure, as defined herein, shall comply with the provisions of this chapter, irrespective of when such vacant structure shall have been constructed, altered or repaired, and irrespective of any permits or licenses which shall have been issued for the use or occupancy of the vacant structure, for the construction repair of equipment or facilities, prior to the effective date of this chapter. This chapter is intended and shall be construed as establishing minimum standards for the maintenance and appearance of all vacant structures. It is not intended to replace, modify, supersede or diminish the standards established for the construction, repair, alteration or use of buildings, equipment or facilities by the South Florida Building Code (Ordinance No. 57-22, as amended). In any case where any provision of this chapter is found to be in conflict with a material and controlling provision of zoning regulations, the South Florida Building Code, or any other County or municipal ordinance, code or regulation, or any rules or regulations of the Florida State Board of Health, the provision which establishes the highest standard shall prevail. All County and municipal departments, officials and employees who have the duty, responsibility or authority to issue permits or licenses in regard to the use and occupancy of commercial stuctures, dwellings, dwelling units, rooming houses, or rooming units, as defined in of the Code of Metropolitan Miami-Dade County, or similar facilities, shall conform to the provisions of this chapter, as a minimum standard. It shall be the duty and responsibility of municipal departments, officials and employees to enforce the minimum standards prescribed by the provisions of this chapter within the territorial limits of their respective municipalities.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
