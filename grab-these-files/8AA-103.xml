<text><section>Sec. 8AA-103. Term and renewal.<section>A Registrant shall renew its Registration with the Director by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the Registration requirements in this chapter, except that a Registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within thirty (30) days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to a Registrant shall provide updated information to the Director including, on a street map provided by Miami-Dade County, the routes of a Registrant's system built after the effective date of this chapter. If no information in the then-existing Registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a Registration may result in the Director restricting the issuance of additional permits until the Communications Services Provider has complied with the Registration requirements of this chapter.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
