<text><section>Sec. 2-1067. Legislative intent and purpose.<section>The Board of County Commissioners ("County Commission") finds that the integrity of both the governmental decisionmaking process and the process whereby candidates are elected is essential to the continued functioning of an open government. In order to ensure the integrity of these processes and restore public confidence in government, the County Commission finds it necessary to create the Ethics Commission. The purpose of the Ethics Commission is to serve as the guardian of the public trust by, among other things, educating the public, candidates for elective office, elected and appointed officials and other public servants as to the required standards of ethical conduct and enforcing those standards of conduct. It is not the intent of the County Commission that the Ethics Commission serve as a personnel board resolving personnel matters involving County and municipal employees.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
