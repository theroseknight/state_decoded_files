<text><section>Sec. 33-321. Exceptions.<section>Notwithstanding the issuance of any moratorium order, the County Manager may authorize the issuance of building permits for nondeleterious items including, but not limited to, fences, repairs and like matters, where he determines that such permit will not affect the outcome of the planning study; provided, however, that with regard to any particular moratorium the Board of County Commissioners may by ordinance increase or decrease allowable exemptions and may by ordinance provide either a supplemental or exclusive procedure for acting upon requests for exemptions. Such procedure may vest jurisdiction and responsibility for acting upon requests for exemptions in the County Manager or any County administrative or quasijudicial body or board.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
