<text><section>Sec. 30-281. Traffic control signal devices.<section>Except for automatic warning signal lights installed or to be installed at railroad crossings, whenever traffic, including municipal traffic, is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one (1) at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:<section prefix='(1)'>Green indication.<section prefix='(a)'>Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed cautiously straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.</section><section prefix='(b)'>Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, as directed by the manual, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.</section><section prefix='(c)'>Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 30-275, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.</section></section><section prefix='(2)'>Steady yellow indication.<section prefix='(a)'>Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.</section><section prefix='(b)'>Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 30-275, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway.</section></section><section prefix='(3)'>Steady red indication.<section prefix='(a)'>Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown; provided, however:<section prefix='1.'>The driver of a vehicle which is stopped at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver was a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection in obedience to a steady red signal may make a right turn, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at said intersection, except that municipal and County authorities may prohibit any such right turn against a steady red signal at any intersection, which prohibition shall be effective when a sign giving notice thereof is attached to the traffic control signal device at said intersection.</section><section prefix='2.'>The driver of a vehicle on a one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves to the left shall stop in obedience to a steady red signal, but may then make a left turn into the one-way street, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection, except that municipal and County authorities may prohibit any such left turn as described, which prohibition shall be effective when a sign giving notice thereof is attached to the traffic control signal device at the intersection.</section></section><section prefix='(b)'>Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 30-275, pedestrians facing a steady red signal shall not enter the roadway.</section></section><section prefix='(4)'>In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.</section><section prefix='(5)'>(a)No traffic control signal device shall be used which does not exhibit a yellow or "caution" light between the green or "go" signal and the red or "stop" signal.<section prefix='(b)'>No traffic control signal device shall display other than the color red at the top of the vertical signal, nor shall it display other than the color red at the extreme left of the horizontal signal.</section></section></section></section></text><history>(Ord.
