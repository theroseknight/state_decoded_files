<text><section>Sec. 26-34. Existing Partners.<section>Community-Based Not-For-Profit organizations and Programming Partners currently providing or desiring to provide programming services at County Park and Recreation Facilities may be offered the opportunity to negotiate and/or renew a Programming Partnership Agreement with the Department based on the needs of the Department provided that no such term, extension or renewal shall extend beyond ten (10) years following the effective date of this ordinance. In the event that no agreement can be reached to the mutual satisfaction of the parties, and in any event following the expiration of any agreed upon term, extension or renewal an open competitive RFPP process will be initiated. The Board, upon written recommendation of the County Mayor or the County Mayor's designee, may by two-thirds vote of the members present waive competitive bidding when it finds this to be in the best interest of the County. Nothing in this section shall impair any validly existing contractual rights.</section></section></text><history>(Ord. No. 02-137, ยง 14, 7-23-02; Ord. No. 09-27, ยง 1, 4-7-09)</history></law>
