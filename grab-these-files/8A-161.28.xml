Permits may be issued by the Director subject to such conditions, limitations, and restrictions imposed by the Director as the Director deems necessary to protect consumers and customers, provided such conditions, limitations, and restrictions are consistent with the provisions of this article. Violation of such a condition, limitation or restriction of a permit shall be a violation of this article.

A paint/body apprentice shall be employed by a motor vehicle repair shop which has obtained a registration and shall be required to work under the direct supervision of a motor vehicle body repair technician or motor vehicle paint technician, as the case may be, during the entire time of the apprentice's employment as an apprentice.</section><section prefix='(2)'>The Director may designate schools, academies, or other similar establishments to provide mechanic apprentice or paint/body apprentice education if said establishments, schools, or academies meet criteria for designation established by rules promulgated by the County Manager.
