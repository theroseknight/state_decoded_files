<text><section>Sec. 30-367. Licensing of vehicles.<section>Every vehicle, at all times while driven, stopped or parked upon any highways, roads or streets of this County shall be licensed in the name of the owner thereof in accordance with the laws of Florida, unless such vehicle is not required by the laws of Florida to be licensed in this State, and shall, unless otherwise provided by statute, display the license plate or both of the license plates assigned to it by the State, one (1) on the rear and if two (2), the other on the front of the vehicle, each to be securely fastened to the vehicle outside the main body of the vehicle, in such manner as to prevent the plates from swinging, with all letters, numerals, printing, writing, and other identification marks upon the plates clear and distinct and free from defacement, mutilation, grease and other obscuring matter, so that they shall be plainly visible and legible at all times one hundred (100) feet from the rear or front. No license plates other than those furnished by the State shall be used; provided, however, if the vehicle is not required to be licensed in this State, the license plates on such vehicle issued by another state, or by a territory, possession or district of the United States, or a foreign country, substantially complying with the provisions hereof, shall be considered as complying with this chapter.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
