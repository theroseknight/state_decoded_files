The Hearing Officer shall make findings of fact immediately upon conclusion of the hearing. Once commenced, no hearing shall be deferred, however, the property owner shall have the option to request a reschedule of the hearing. A request to reschedule the hearing shall only be considered prior to the commencement of the testimony and presentation of evidence.

However, once an issue has been determined by a Hearing Officer in a specific case, that issue may not be further reviewed by a County board in that specific case. A named property owner waives his right to administrative appeal to other County boards if the property owner does not apply for such appeal prior to the property owner's administrative appeal hearing before the Hearing Officer.<section prefix='(2)'>Upon exhaustion of a timely filed administrative appeal and finalization of the administrative order by such board, the Hearing Officer may exercise all powers given to him by this chapter.

In the event such a board decides that an alleged violation of the Code is not in accordance with such board's interpretation of the Code provision on which the violation is based, the Hearing Officer shall not be empowered to proceed with the enforcement of the violation.</section></section><section prefix='(s)'>Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Hearing Officer on appeal taken to it, including, but not limited to, the Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer, may apply to the Circuit Court of Miami-Dade County for review by writ of certiorari in accordance with the applicable Florida Appellate Rules. For such purposes, the Clerk of the Court shall make available for public inspection and copying the record of each such decision to be reviewed; provided, such Clerk may make a reasonable charge commensurate with the costs, in the event he/she is able to and does furnish copies of all or portions of such records.
