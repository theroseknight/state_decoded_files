<text><section>Sec. 14-51. Strict liability.<section>Whenever a violation of this article or of the South Florida Fire Prevention Code or of a more stringent municipal fire safety standard occurs or exists, any person, individually or otherwise who has a legal, beneficial or equitable interest in the facility or instrumentality causing or contributing to the violation or who has a legal, beneficial, or equitable interest in the real property upon which such facility or instrumentality is located shall be jointly and severally liable for said violation regardless of fault and regardless of knowledge of the violation. This provision shall be construed to impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault and regardless of knowledge of the violation, upon all persons, individually or otherwise, who, although no longer having any such legal, beneficial or equitable interest in said facility or instrumentality or real property, did have such an interest at any time during which such violation existed or occurred or continued to exist or to occur. This provision shall be liberally construed and shall be retroactively applied to protect the public health, safety, and welfare and to accomplish the purposes of this article and the South Florida Fire Prevention Code.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
