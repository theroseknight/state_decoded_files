<text><section>Sec. 33-202.4. Purpose and intent.<section>It is the intent of these regulations to create a Rowhouse District to be applied in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. Further, it is the purpose and intent of these regulations to create developments at a pedestrian scale; to create a streetscape which is convenient and comfortable for walking; to form a clear edge of public and private buildings, spatially delineating the public street space from private block interiors; to encourage pedestrian interaction between the development site and public areas; to provide a range of building elevations; to provide an identity, visual interest and diversity, and to provide opportunities for citizens to know their neighbors and watch over their collective security.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
