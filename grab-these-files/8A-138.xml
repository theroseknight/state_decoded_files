<text><section>Sec. 8A-138. Time limitations.<section>The Licensee shall, within sixty (60) days after the issuance of said License, apply to the Federal Communications Commission for any required permits or Licenses and shall begin service within one (1) year thereafter. Following the receipt of all required permits and Licenses and other necessary approvals, the Licensee shall accomplish significant construction of its cable television system and shall thereafter reasonably and equitably extend energized trunk cable to twenty (20) percent of the Licensee's County-franchised area each year, until service is available to substantially all residents of such area. Additional time to complete construction may be granted by the County Manager for good cause shown upon request of the Licensee. Licensee need not, but may, at its option, provide service to areas having fewer than sixty (60) homes in front of each linear mile of trunk line cable.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
