<text><section>Sec. 2-395.3. Removal of members.<section>Any voting member of the Task Force who ceases to be a qualified elector of Miami-Dade County shall immediately forfeit his or her office, unless the Board of County Commissioners, by a two-thirds vote of its membership, waives that requirement. Should a vacancy result from such forfeiture, or should any member of the Task Force fail to attend three (3) consecutive meetings of the Task Force without cause, or a majority of the meetings held by the Task Force during any fiscal year, the Chairperson of the Task Force shall certify that fact to the Board of County Commissioners, which shall then by appointment fill the vacancy created. Any member of the Task Force may be removed without cause by a majority of the entire membership of the Board of County Commissioners.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
