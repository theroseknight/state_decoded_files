Review by certiorari.<section>Any party aggrieved by the administrative decision may have such decision reviewed by the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Dade County, Florida, for a review of the record upon which the decision is based, in accordance with the procedure and within the time provided by the Florida Appellate Rules for the review of the rulings of any commission or Board, which rules of practice and procedure are hereby adopted. For such purposes, the County Manager shall make available for public inspection and copying the record of each such decision to be reviewed; provided, the Manager may make a reasonable charge commensurate with the cost, in the event he is able to and does furnish copies of all or any portion of the record at the hearing. Prior to certifying a copy of any record or portion thereof, the Manager or his designee shall make all necessary corrections in order that the copy is a true and correct copy of the record, or those portions thereof requested, and shall make a charge of not more than twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page, instrument or exhibit; provided the charges here authorized are not intended to repeal or amend any fee or schedule of fees otherwise established.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
