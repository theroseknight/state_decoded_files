<text><section>Sec. 7-59. Mooring and anchoring.<section>Mooring and anchoring of barges in the navigable waters of Dade County shall continue to be in accordance with accepted practices and regulations except as provided herein. Owners of barges shall take action to insure that their barges are moved from open waters to areas of safe anchorage in sheltered waters, as defined herein, immediately upon the issuance of a storm or hurricane warning which includes the area of Dade County in which the barges are located. The practice of scuttling as an aid in securing an anchored or moored barge will be permitted provided that the barge is hard aground in water not ordinarily used by other craft and is properly marked according to current federal regulations so as not to constitute a menace to navigation.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
