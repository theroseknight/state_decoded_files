<text><section>Sec. 21-115. Children under ten years of age prohibited from entering fields.<section>It shall be unlawful for any parent or other person acting in loco parentis, or the owner or lessee of a self-harvest field open to the public to permit a child under ten (10) years of age to enter upon such field, unless said owner or lessee has a designed area specifically approved for children under ten (10) years of age, and unless said parent or other person acting in loco parentis accompanies said child. Said designated area shall be inspected annually by the County Manager or his designated agent and must at all times be roped off in a manner that would prevent a child from leaving said designated area. Upon payment of an annual twenty-five-dollar-fee, the County Manager or his designated agent shall conduct the inspection and if the designated area is properly and securely roped off, issue the permit. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the County shall not be liable for any injury caused by the owner or lessee failing to maintain the designated area properly.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
