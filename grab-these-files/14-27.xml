<text><section>Sec. 14-27. Procedure to lawfully burn land.<section>It is unlawful for any person carelessly to burn or cause to be burned, or to set fire to or cause fire to be set to, any forest, grass, woods, wild lands or marshes owned or controlled by such person without first giving notice to all resident owners, managers or tenants of lands adjoining and surrounding the area to be burned, said notice to be given in the presence of at least one (1) witness or in writing, not less than one (1) nor more than ten (10) days prior to such burning; or to fail to take reasonable precaution against the spreading of fire to other lands by providing adequate fire lines, man-power and fire fighting equipment for the control of such fire, or to watch over said fire until it is extinguished, or to permit fire to escape to adjoining lands; provided, however, that no notice shall be required to be given of the setting of fire in a forest protection district where written permission to set such fire has been obtained from a duly appointed Fire Warden.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
