A copy of said notice of seizure shall also be given to the proprietor of such secured facility.</section><section prefix='(2)'>Whenever an officer or designated employee seizes a vehicle under this section, and does not know and is not able to ascertain the name of the owner, or for any other reason is unable to give the notice to the owner as hereinabove provided, then and in that event the officer or designated employee shall immediately send or cause to be sent a written report of such removal by mail to the Motor Vehicle Commissioner of the Miami-Dade Police Department.</section></section><section prefix='(C)'>Vehicle impoundment hearing. Whenever the owner of record of a vehicle seized pursuant to this section makes a request of the CSD in person and in writing for a vehicle impoundment hearing within ten (10) days of seizure exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, a magistrate, as provided in Section 318.32, Florida Statutes, a county court judge or a hearing examiner, who shall not have responsibility for the enforcement at this article and who shall be designated by the CSD Director, shall conduct the hearing within twenty-four (24) hours or as soon as practicable, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. All interested persons shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard at the vehicle impoundment hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. If, after the hearing, the magistrate, county court judge or hearing examiner determines that there is no probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment under subsection (A), the magistrate, county court judge or hearing examiner shall order the immediate return of the vehicle. If, after the hearing, the magistrate, county court judge or hearing examiner determines that there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment under subsection (A), the magistrate, county court judge or hearing examiner shall order the immediate return of the vehicle. If, after the hearing, the magistrate, County Court Judge or Hearing Examiner determines that there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment under subsection (A), the Magistrate, County Court Judge or Hearing Examiner shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section unless the owner of the vehicle (1) posts with the court or CSD a cash bond in the amount of the maximum fine(s), plus any applicable towing and storage fees, or (2) pleads guilty or nolo contendere and pays in full any towing and storage fees plus the fine(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the hearing, it is determined that there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to forfeiture proceedings pursuant to section 31-116(G), said vehicle shall not be released.</section><section prefix='(D)'>Hearing regarding Code violation charged in field enforcement report and/or complaint/arrest affidavit. Within ten (10) days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this section or as soon as practicable, the CSD and/or the Clerk's Office shall notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, the owner of record of the date, time and location of a hearing that will be conducted regarding the Code violations charged in the field enforcement report, the complaint/arrest affidavit or other charging instrument.

The fine(s), if any, and removal and storage fees must be paid in order to obtain an order for release of the seized vehicle.

When a post-seizure adversarial preliminary hearing as provided herein is requested, it shall be held within ten (10) days after the request or as soon as practicable. If the court determines that the required probable cause exists, the court shall order the property restrained by the least restrictive means to protect against disposal, waste, or continued illegal use pending disposition of the forfeiture proceeding. If the court orders the release of the vehicle, all fines, if any, and towing and storage fees shall be paid prior to release.</section><section prefix='(4)'>Neither replevin nor any other action to recover any interest in such property shall be maintained in any court, except as provided in this section; however, such action may be maintained if forfeiture proceedings are not initiated within forty-five (45) days after the date of seizure.
