<text><section>Sec. 2-98.8. Costs.<section>In the event that the Board declares a place or premises to be a nuisance and issues an order pursuant to(e)(2) above, the Board shall assess against the owner of the place or premises the costs which the County has incurred in the preparation, investigation, and presentation of the case. These costs shall be due and payable ten (10) days after the written order of the Board has been filed. A certified copy of an order imposing costs may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists or, if the violator does not own the land, upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator; and it may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state including levy against the personal property, but shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. After one year from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, Miami-Dade County may foreclose or otherwise execute on the lien. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid costs at the legal rate of interest set forth in Section 55.03, Florida Statute as that may be amended from time to time.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
