All walls and fences shall be maintained in good, clean and finished condition. A fence with a finished and unfinished side shall be erected so that the unfinished side and supporting members face inward toward the interior of the property. Furthermore, all fences shall have the finished side facing the neighboring property or street (outward). A continuous wall or fence that is owned by multiple property owners or held in common ownership shall be of uniform construction and materials and its exterior shall also be maintained in good, clean and finished condition for the entire length of said wall or fence. Each side of a CBS wall shall be completely finished with stucco and paint. Each side of a decorative masonry wall shall be completely painted; however, walls comprised of decorative brick and natural stone may be left unpainted provided the cement and grout are finished on both sides. If a wall is to be placed on a shared property line, consent for access must be obtained from the adjoining property owner(s) prior to finishing the opposite side of the wall. If such consent cannot be obtained, the property owner erecting the wail must present proof that a request for access approval was mailed to every adjacent property owner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing address(es) as listed in the most current Miami-Dade County tax roll, and the mailing was returned undeliverable or the adjacent property owner(s) failed to respond to the request within thirty (30) days after receipt. Upon such a showing, the property owner erecting the wall shall not be required to finish the opposite side of the wall.</section><section prefix='(c)'>Height at intersection. Fences, walls, bus shelters or hedges shall not exceed two and one-half (2.5) feet in height within the safe sight distance triangle, as defined below.

The average elevation shall be measured along both sides of the wall, hedge or fence line. Virgin land may not be increased or decreased to affect the permitted (or required) height of a wall, hedge or fence unless the entire building site is graded to even out the level of the site or to increase it to the required Miami-Dade County flood criteria elevation. Average elevation shall be determined by taking elevations along both sides of the wall, hedge or fence line, at five-foot intervals and totaling the same and then dividing the total by the number of stations at which the elevations were taken.</section><section prefix='(e)'>Height between different districts.
