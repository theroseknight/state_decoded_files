Fire Protection and Rescue Services Master Plan for the Miami-Dade County Area—Legal status.<section>The Fire Protection and Rescue Services Master Plan for the Miami-Dade County Area is hereby declared to be a further refinement of the Comprehensive Development Master Plan of Miami-Dade County, Florida, and shall constitute a guide for the orderly growth and development of Miami-Dade County, Florida. In furtherance thereof, the Board of County Commissioners declares its policy and intent to evaluate and consider the criteria established in the Fire Protection and Rescue Services Master Plan for the Miami-Dade County Area as an element in future land planning and development decisions. The failure or inability of Miami-Dade County or others to meet any criteria in the plan shall not, in and of itself, constitute grounds for restrictions or limitations on land use or development, or for the denial of any application for zoning.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
