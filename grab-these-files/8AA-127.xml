<text><section>Sec. 8AA-127. Termination of Registration.<section>The County may declare a forfeiture and termination of, and revoke and cancel all rights granted under this Registration if (a) a federal/state authority suspends, denies, or revokes a Communications Services Provider's certification to provide Communications Services; (b) the Registrant's use of the public rights-of-way presents a danger to the general public and other users of the public rights-of-way; or, (c) the Registrant has abandoned its Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way and has not complied with Section 8AA-127.1. Prior to such termination by the County, the Registrant shall be served by the County with a written notice setting forth all matters pertinent to the termination action, including which of (a) through (c) above is applicable as the reason therefore, and describing the action of the County with respect thereto. The Registrant shall have sixty (60) days after service of such notice within which to address or eliminate the reason, or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the County, to accomplish the same. In the event of such termination, the Registrant shall, within a reasonable time following demand by the County, remove or abandon the Communications Facilities and take such steps as are necessary to render every portion of the Communications Facilities remaining within the public rights-of-way of the County safe, and shall thereupon be deemed to have abandoned same in its entirety; and the same shall thereupon become the sole property of the County without payment to the Registrant. If Miami-Dade County agrees to abandonment, the Registrant shall incur, from that time forward, no future obligations with respect to the Communications Facilities.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
