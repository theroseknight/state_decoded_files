<text><section>Sec. 8A-251. Declaration of legislative intent.<section>It is the intent of the Board of County Commissioners to provide a uniform meat identification system relating to the sale of meats at retail to the consumers of Miami-Dade County. The Board finds and determines that shoppers in Miami-Dade County's retail food stores are often faced with a problem of not knowing what type or quality of meat is being offered for sale because of misleading, false, deceptive or confusing meat labeling. Further, that shoppers often find that meats advertised for sale are unavailable when they seek to purchase such advertised meats because of limited quantities and that the limit on quantity was not disclosed in the advertisement. The Board finds that these and other practices and problems relative to the sale of meat at retail result in higher food costs, inconvenience and confusion to consumers. It is the intention of the Board that this article be liberally construed to accomplish its objective of providing to consumers fair information as to the meat products they purchase.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
