<text><section>Sec. 15-2.9. Relation to state and federal law.<section>All provisions of this ordinance are intended to be consistent with other federal, state and local requirements. To the extent that compliance with any of the requirements is a physical impossibility while concurrently complying with other federal or state requirements, the affected person may request a hearing before the board of county commissioners to demonstrate this. The county manager shall amend these requirements to the extent that such physical impossibility is shown. However, to the extent that requirements specified herein are more stringent than federal or state requirements, the person shall comply with both such requirements.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
