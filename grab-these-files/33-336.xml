<text><section>Sec. 33-336. Establishment of airport land use zoning map, criteria and use restrictions for Miami International Airport and surrounding zones and sub-zones.<section>The Board of County Commissioners hereby adopts, approves and ratifies the map "Airport Land Use Zoning Map for Miami International Airport and Surrounding Area," as prepared by the Miami-Dade Aviation Department MDAD, dated July 19, 2004, reflecting the location and identifying Miami International Airport and other topographic data pertinent thereto depicting the boundaries of the airport zoning area and the land use zones and sub-zones. Such map establishes the boundaries of the airport zoning area, land use zones and sub-zones, and the prohibitions, restrictions and limitations on uses permitted thereon. The above defined map, which is on file in the Miami-Dade County Department of Planning and Zoning, shall be an official land use zoning map for the Miami International Airport and surrounding area, shall evidence the boundaries of the zones and sub-zones depicted thereon, and shall be applicable to and controlling of zoning for such land use zones and sub-zones.<section prefix='(A)'>For the purpose of this article all of the land use zoning criteria for Miami International Airport, and surrounding area, as the same is created established and described hereinbefore, is hereby divided into zones as follows:<section prefix='(1)'>Inner Safety Zone (ISZ), also referred to as the Runway Protection Zone (RPZ). For Miami International Airport, the ISZ is defined as an area which is centered about the extended runway centerline and begins 200 feet beyond the end of the area usable for take-off or landing. The ISZ dimension for Runways 12/30, 9R/27L, 9L/27R and 8/26 begin at a width of 1,000 feet and extends 2,500 feet to a width of 1,750 feet. The ISZ dimension for Runways 8/26 begin at a width of five hundred (500) feet and extends one thousand seven hundred (1,700) feet to a width of one thousand ten (1,010) feet.</section><section prefix='(2)'>Outer Safety Zone (OSZ). The OSZ is described as an area that extends outward from the ISZ to a point that is five thousand (5,000) feet from the runway end. The OSZ dimensions for Runways 12/30, 9R/27L and 9L/27R begin at a width of 1,750 feet and extend outward 2,300 feet to a width at 2,440 feet. The OSZ dimensions for Runways 8/26 begin at a width of one thousand ten (1,010) feet and extend outward three thousand one hundred (3,100) feet to a width at one thousand nine hundred forty (1,940) feet.</section><section prefix='(3)'>Inner Land Use Zone (ILZ). An ILZ for Miami International Airport is considered to be within the 75 decibel and greater Day Night Noise Level (DNL) Noise Contour which depicts concentrations of aircraft noise around an airport based on day night noise levels averaged over a year. The ILZ is depicted on the Airport Land Use Zoning Map for Miami International Airport and Surrounding Area defined herein.</section><section prefix='(4)'>Outer Land Use Zone (OLZ). The OLZ for Miami International Airport is within the 65 to 74 decibel Day Night Noise Level (DNL) Noise Contour, which depicts concentrations of aircraft noise around an airport based on day night noise levels averaged over a year. The OLZ is depicted on the Airport Land Use Zoning Map for Miami International Airport and Surrounding Area defined herein.</section><section prefix='(5)'>Critical Area Approach Zone (CA). A CA for each runway at Miami International Airport covers an area that extends five (5) statute miles from the end of a runway in a direct line along the extended centerline of the runway, and has a width measuring one-half (Â½) the length of the longest runway at Miami International Airport. The CA for each runway consist of a CA-A, a CA-B and a CA-C sub-zone. The CA-A is the area closest to the runway and extends out two (2) miles from the end of the runway; the CA-B extends out the next one-and-one-half miles from the end of the CA-A; and the CA-C extends out the remaining one-and-one-half miles from the end of the CA-B. The CA is depicted on the Airport Land Use Zoning Map for Miami International Airport and Surrounding Area.</section></section><section prefix='(B)'>No land, body of water or structure shall be used, or permitted to be used and no structures shall be hereafter erected, constructed, moved or reconstructed, structurally altered or maintained for any purpose in the Miami International Airport (Wilcox Field) Zoning Area, which is designed, arranged, or intended to be used or occupied for any purpose otherwise permitted in the underlying zoning district, except in compliance with the following restrictions, limitations and prohibitions:<section prefix='(1)'>Inner Safety Zone (ISZ).
